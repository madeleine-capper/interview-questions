    "Q1. What is the Central Limit Theorem and why is it important?\n",
    "https://spin.atomicobject.com/2015/02/12/central-limit-theorem-intro/\n",
    "Suppose that we are interested in estimating the average height among all people. Collecting data for every person in the world is impractical, bordering on impossible. While we can’t obtain a height measurement from everyone in the population, we can still sample some people. The question now becomes, what can we say about the average height of the entire population given a single sample.\n",
    "The Central Limit Theorem addresses this question exactly. Formally, it states that if we sample from a\n",
    "EX:\n",
    "As we can see, the distribution is pretty ugly. It certainly isn’t normal, uniform, or any other commonly known distribution. In order to sample from the above distribution, we need to define a sample size, referred to as N. This is the number of observations that we will sample at a time. Suppose that we choose N to be 3. This means that we will sample in groups of 3. So for the above population, we might sample groups such as [5, 20, 41], [60, 17, 82], [8, 13, 61], and so on.\n",
    "Suppose that we gather 1,000 samples of 3 from the above population. For each sample, we can compute its average. If we do that, we will have 1,000 averages. This set of 1,000 averages is called a sampling distribution, and according to Central Limit Theorem, the sampling distribution will approach a normal distribution as the sample size N used to produce it increases. Here is what our sample distribution looks like for N = 3.\n",
    "   population using a sufficiently large sample size, the mean of the samples (also known as the sample population) will be normally distributed (assuming true random sampling), the mean tending to the mean of the population and variance equal to the variance of the population divided by the size of the sampling. What’s especially important is that this will be true regardless of the distribution of the original\n",
    " population.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  As we can see, it certainly looks uni-modal, though not necessarily normal. If we repeat the same process with a larger sample size, we should see the sampling distribution start to become more normal. Let’s repeat the same process again with N = 10. Here is the sampling distribution for that sample size.\n",
    "Q2. What is sampling? How many sampling methods do you know?\n",
    "https://searchbusinessanalytics.techtarget.com/definition/data-sampling https://nikolanews.com/difference-between-stratified-sampling-cluster-sampling-and-quota-sampling/\n",
    "It enables data scientists, predictive modelers and other data analysts to work with a small, manageable amount of data about a statistical population to build and run analytical models more quickly, while still producing\n",
    "accurate findings.\n",
    "     Data sampling is a statistical analysis technique used to select, manipulate and analyze a representative\n",
    " subset of data points to identify patterns and trends in the larger data set being examined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling can be particularly useful with data sets that are too large to efficiently analyze in full – for example, in big data analytics applications or surveys. Identifying and analyzing a representative sample is more efficient and cost-effective than surveying the entirety of the data or population.\n",
    "An important consideration, though, is the size of the required data sample and the possibility of introducing a sampling error. In some cases, a small sample can reveal the most important information about a data set. In others, using a larger sample can increase the likelihood of accurately representing the data as a whole, even though the increased size of the sample may impede ease of manipulation and interpretation.\n",
    "There are many different methods for drawing samples from data; the ideal one depends on the data set and situation. Sampling can be\n",
    "Further variations in probability sampling include:\n",
    "• Simple random sampling: Software is used to randomly select subjects from the whole population.\n",
    "• Stratified sampling: Subsets of the data sets or population are created based on a common factor, and samples are randomly collected from each subgroup. A sample is drawn from each strata\n",
    "(using a random sampling method like simple random sampling or systematic sampling).\n",
    "o EX: In the image below, let's say you need a sample size of 6. Two members from each group (yellow, red, and blue) are selected randomly. Make sure to sample proportionally: In this simple example, 1/3 of each group (2/6 yellow, 2/6 red and 2/6 blue) has been sampled. If you have one group that's a different size, make sure to adjust your proportions. For example, if you had 9 yellow, 3 red and 3 blue, a 5-item sample would consist of 3/9 yellow (i.e. one third), 1/3 red and 1/3 blue.\n",
    "• Cluster sampling: The larger data set is divided into subsets (clusters) based on a defined factor, then a random sampling of clusters is analyzed. The sampling unit is the whole cluster; Instead of sampling individuals from within each group, a researcher will study whole clusters.\n",
    "o EX: In the image below, the strata are natural groupings by head color (yellow, red, blue). A sample size of 6 is needed, so two of the complete strata are selected randomly (in this example, groups 2 and 4 are chosen).\n",
    "• Multistage sampling: A more complicated form of cluster sampling, this method also involves dividing the larger population into a number of clusters. Second-stage clusters are then broken out based on a secondary factor, and those clusters are then sampled and analyzed. This staging could continue as multiple subsets are identified, clustered and analyzed.\n",
    "• Systematic sampling: A sample is created by setting an interval at which to extract data from the larger population – for example, selecting every 10th row in a spreadsheet of 200 items to create a sample size of 20 rows to analyze.\n",
    "based on probability, an approach that uses random numbers that\n",
    "  correspond to points in the data set to ensure that there is no correlation between points chosen for the\n",
    " sample.\n",
    " \n",
    " Sampling can also be\n",
    "As inclusion is determined by the analyst, it can be more difficult to extrapolate whether the sample accurately represents the larger population than when\n",
    "probability sampling is used.\n",
    "Non-probability data sampling methods include:\n",
    "• Convenience sampling: Data is collected from an easily accessible and available group.\n",
    "• Consecutive sampling: Data is collected from every subject that meets the criteria until the\n",
    "predetermined sample size is met.\n",
    "• Purposive or judgmental sampling: The researcher selects the data to sample based on predefined\n",
    "criteria.\n",
    "• Quota sampling: The researcher ensures equal representation within the sample for all subgroups\n",
    "in the data set or population (random sampling is not used).\n",
    "Once generated, a sample can be used for predictive analytics. For example, a retail business might use data sampling to uncover patterns about customer behavior and predictive modeling to create more effective sales strategies.\n",

    "The p-value in the table is the minimum 􏰃 (the significance level) at which the coefficient is relevant. The lower the p-value, the more important is the variable in predicting the price. Usually we set a 5% level, so that we have a 95% confidentiality that our variable is relevant.\n",
    "The p-value is used as an alternative to rejection points to provide the smallest level of significance at which the null hypothesis would be rejected. A smaller p-value means that there is stronger evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "The coefficient value signifies how much the mean of the dependent variable changes given a one-unit shift in the independent variable while holding other variables in the model constant. This property of holding the other variables constant is crucial because it allows you to assess the effect of each variable in isolation from the others.\n",

That is, the effect of one independent variable on the dependent variable of interest may not be the same at all levels of the other independent variable. Another way to put this is that the effect of one independent variable may depend on the level of the other independent variable. In order to find an interaction, you must have a factorial design, in which the two (or more)\n",

    "Bias-Variance trade-off: The goal of any supervised machine learning algorithm is to have low bias and low variance to achieve good prediction performance.\n",
    "1. The k-nearest neighbor algorithm has low bias and high variance, but the trade-off can be changed by increasing the value of k which increases the number of neighbors that contribute to the prediction and in turn increases the bias of the model.\n",
    "2. The support vector machine algorithm has low bias and high variance, but the trade-off can be changed by increasing the C parameter that influences the number of violations of the margin allowed in the training data which increases the bias but decreases the variance.\n",

Because this approach involves repeating the original data analysis procedure with many replicate sets of data, these are sometimes called computer-intensive methods.

However, XGBoost is more difficult to understand, visualize and to tune compared to AdaBoost and random forests. There is a multitude of hyperparameters that can be tuned to increase performance.\n",

    "• Which is the best question to ask at each node\n",
    "• When do we stop splitting the data further?\n",
    "Let’s start building the tree with the first or the topmost node. There is a list of possible questions which can be asked. The first node can ask the following questions:\n",

    "Q22. During analysis, how do you treat missing values?\n",
    "The extent of the missing values is identified after identifying the variables with missing values. If any patterns are identified the analyst has to concentrate on them as it could lead to interesting and meaningful business insights.\n",
    "If there are no patterns identified, then the missing values can be substituted with mean or median values (imputation) or they can simply be ignored. Assigning a default value which can be mean, minimum or maximum value. Getting into the data is important.\n",
    "If it is a categorical variable, the default value is assigned. The missing value is assigned a default value. If you have a distribution of data coming, for normal distribution give the mean value.\n",
    "If 80% of the values for a variable are missing, then you can answer that you would be dropping the variable instead of treating the missing values.\n",
    "Q23. How will you define the number of clusters in a clustering algorithm?\n",
    "https://stackabuse.com/hierarchical-clustering-with-python-and-scikit-learn/\n",
    "Though the Clustering Algorithm is not specified, this question is mostly in reference to K-Means clustering where “K” defines the number of clusters. The objective of clustering is to group similar entities in a way that the entities within a group are similar to each other, but the groups are different from each other.\n",
    " \n",
    "For example, the following image shows three different groups.\n",
    "Within Sum of squares is generally used to explain the homogeneity within a cluster. If you plot WSS (as the sum of the squared distance between each member of the cluster and its centroid) for a range of number of clusters, you will get the plot shown below.\n",
    "• The Graph is generally known as Elbow Curve.\n",
    "• Red circled a point in above graph i.e. Number of Cluster = 3 is the point after which you don’t see\n",
    "any decrement in WSS.\n",
    "• This point is known as the bending point and taken as K in K – Means.\n",
    "       \n",
    "This is the widely used approach but few data scientists also use Hierarchical clustering first to create dendrograms and identify the distinct groups from there.\n",
    "  The algorithm starts by finding the two points that are closest to each other on the basis of Euclidean distance. If we look back at Graph1, we can see that points 2 and 3 are closest to each other while points 7 and 8 are closes to each other. Therefore a cluster will be formed between these two points first. In Graph2, you can see that the dendograms have been created joining points 2 with 3, and 8 with 7. The vertical height of the dendogram shows the Euclidean distances between points. From Graph2, it can be seen that Euclidean distance between points 8 and 7 is greater than the distance between point 2 and 3. The next step is to join the cluster formed by joining two points to the next nearest cluster or point which in turn results in another cluster. If you look at Graph1, point 4 is closest to cluster of point 2 and 3, therefore in Graph2 dendrogram is generated by joining point 4 with dendrogram of point 2 and 3. This process continues until all the points are joined together to form one big cluster.\n",
    "Once one big cluster is formed, the longest vertical distance without any horizontal line passing through it is selected and a horizontal line is drawn through it. The number of vertical lines this newly created horizontal line passes is equal to number of clusters. Take a look at the following plot:\n",
    " \n",
    "We can see that the largest vertical distance without any horizontal line passing through it is represented by blue line. So we draw a new horizontal red line that passes through the blue line. Since it crosses the blue line at two points, therefore the number of clusters will be 2. Basically the horizontal line is a threshold, which defines the minimum distance required to be a separate cluster. If we draw a line further down, the threshold required to be a new cluster will be decreased and more clusters will be formed as see in the image below:\n",
    "In the above plot, the horizontal line passes through four vertical lines resulting in four clusters: cluster of points 6,7,8 and 10, cluster of points 3,2,4 and points 9 and 5 will be treated as single point clusters.\n",

    "Ø During the sampling of train data, there are many observations which overlaps. So, the combination of these learners helps in overcoming the high variance.\n",
    "Ø Bagging uses Bootstrap sampling method (Bootstrappingis any test or metric that uses random sampling with replacement and falls under the broader class of resampling methods.)\n",

    "Ø Multiple boosting techniques are available. For example: AdaBoost, LPBoost, XGBoost,\n",

    "Cons\n",
    "Ø Boosting technique often ignores overfitting or variance issues in the data set.\n",
    "  Bagging tries to implement similar learners on small sample populations and then takes a mean of all the predictions. In generalized bagging, you can use different learners on different population. As you expect\n",
    " this helps us to reduce the variance error.\n",
    " Boosting is an iterative technique which adjusts the weight of an observation based on the last classification. If an observation was classified incorrectly, it tries to increase the weight of this observation and vice versa. Boosting in general decreases the bias error and builds strong predictive models. However,\n",

    "However, you could actually face such an issue in reality. So, you could check out the best laptop for Machine Learning to prevent that. Having said that, let’s move on to some questions on deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning\n",
    "Q1. What do you mean by Deep Learning?\n",
    "Deep Learning is nothing but a paradigm of machine learning which has shown incredible promise in recent years. This is because of the fact that Deep Learning shows a great analogy with the functioning of the neurons in the human brain.\n",
    "Q2. What is the difference between machine learning and deep learning?\n",
    "https://parsers.me/deep-learning-machine-learning-whats-the-difference/\n",
    "Machine learning is a field of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning can be categorized in the following four categories.\n",
    "1. Supervised machine learning,\n",
    "2. Semi-supervised machine learning,\n",
    "3. Unsupervised machine learning,\n",
    "4. Reinforcement learning.\n",
    "     \n",
    "Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks.\n",
    "• The main difference between deep learning and machine learning is due to the way data is presented in the system. Machine learning algorithms almost always require structured data, while deep learning networks rely on layers of ANN (artificial neural networks).\n",
    "• Machine learning algorithms are designed to “learn” to act by understanding labeled data and then use it to produce new results with more datasets. However, when the result is incorrect, there is a need to “teach them”. Because machine learning algorithms require bulleted data, they are not suitable for solving complex queries that involve a huge amount of data.\n",
    "• Deep learning networks do not require human intervention, as multilevel layers in neural networks place data in a hierarchy of different concepts, which ultimately learn from their own mistakes. However, even they can be wrong if the data quality is not good enough.\n",
    "• Data decides everything. It is the quality of the data that ultimately determines the quality of the result.\n",
    "• Both of these subsets of AI are somehow connected to data, which makes it possible to represent a certain form of “intelligence.” However, you should be aware that deep learning requires much more data than a traditional machine learning algorithm. The reason for this is that deep learning networks can identify different elements in neural network layers only when more than a million data points interact. Machine learning algorithms, on the other hand, are capable of learning by pre-programmed criteria.\n",
    "Q3. What, in your opinion, is the reason for the popularity of Deep Learning in recent times?\n",
    "Now although Deep Learning has been around for many years, the major breakthroughs from these techniques came just in recent years. This is because of two main reasons:\n",
    "• The increase in the amount of data generated through various sources\n",
    "• The growth in hardware resources required to run these models\n",
    "GPUs are multiple times faster and they help us build bigger and deeper deep learning models in comparatively less time than we required previously.\n",
    "Q4. What is reinforcement learning?\n",
    "  \n",
    "Reinforcement Learning allows to take actions to max cumulative reward. It learns by trial and error through reward/penalty system. Environment rewards agent so by time agent makes better decisions. Ex: robot=agent, maze=environment. Used for complex tasks (self-driving cars, game AI).\n",
    "RL is a series of time steps in a Markov Decision Process: 1. Environment: space in which RL operates\n",
    "2. State: data related to past action RL took\n",
    "3. Action: action taken\n",
    "4. Reward: number taken by agent after last action\n",
    "5. Observation: data related to environment: can be visible or partially shadowed\n",
    "Q5. What are Artificial Neural Networks?\n",
    "Artificial Neural networks are a specific set of algorithms that have revolutionized machine learning. They are inspired by biological neural networks. Neural Networks can adapt to changing the input, so the network generates the best possible result without needing to redesign the output criteria.\n",
    "Q6. Describe the structure of Artificial Neural Networks?\n",
    "Artificial Neural Networks works on the same principle as a biological Neural Network. It consists of inputs which get processed with weighted sums and Bias, with the help of Activation Functions.\n",
    "Q7. How Are Weights Initialized in a Network?\n",
    "There are two methods here: we can either initialize the weights to zero or assign them randomly.\n",
    "Initializing all weights to 0: This makes your model similar to a linear model. All the neurons and every layer perform the same operation, giving the same output and making the deep net useless.\n",
    "Initializing all weights randomly:\n",
    "  Here, the weights are assigned randomly by initializing them very close\n",
    "  to 0. It gives better accuracy to the model since every neuron performs different computations. This is the\n",
    " most commonly used method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. What Is the Cost Function?\n",
    "The most known one is the mean sum of squared errors.\n",
    "􏰄􏰆􏰅 =􏱅(∑(􏰫􏰅􏱀􏰅)+􏰁) Q9. What Are Hyperparameters?\n",
    "With neural networks, you’re usually working with hyperparameters once the data is formatted correctly. A hyperparameter is a parameter whose value is set before the learning process begins. It determines how a network is trained and the structure of the network (such as the number of hidden units, the learning rate, epochs, batches, etc.).\n",
    "Q10. What Will Happen If the Learning Rate Is Set inaccurately (Too Low or Too High)?\n",
    "When your learning rate is too low, training of the model will progress very slowly as we are making minimal updates to the weights. It will take many updates before reaching the minimum point.\n",
    "If the learning rate is set too high, this causes undesirable divergent behavior to the loss function due to drastic updates in weights. It may fail to converge (model can give a good output) or even diverge (data is too chaotic for the network to train).\n",
    "Q11. What Is The Difference Between Epoch, Batch, and Iteration in Deep Learning?\n",
    "• Epoch – Represents one iteration over the entire dataset (everything put into the training model).\n",
    "• Batch – Refers to when we cannot pass the entire dataset into the neural network at once, so we\n",
    "divide the dataset into several batches.\n",
    "• Iteration – if we have 10,000 images as data and a batch size of 200. then an epoch should run 50\n",
    "iterations (10,000 divided by 50).\n",
    "Q12. What Are the Different Layers on CNN?\n",
    "https://towardsdatascience.com/basics-of-the-classic-cnn-a3dce1225add\n",
    " Also referred to as “loss” or “error,” cost function is a measure to evaluate how good your model’s performance is. It’s used to compute the error of the output layer during backpropagation. We push that\n",
    " error backwards through the neural network and use that during the different training functions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  The Convolutional neural networks are regularized versions of multilayer perceptron (MLP). They were\n",
    " developed based on the working of the neurons of the animal visual cortex.\n",
    " Let’s say we have a color image in JPG form and its size is 480 x 480. The representative array will be 480 x 480 x 3. Each of these numbers is given a value from 0 to 255 which describes the pixel intensity at that point. RGB intensity values of the image are visualized by the computer for processing.\n",
    "The objective of using the CNN:\n",
    "It works similar to how our brain works. When we look at a picture of a dog, we can classify it as such if the picture has identifiable features such as paws or 4 legs. In a similar way, the computer is able to perform image classification by looking for low-level features such as edges and curves and then building up to more abstract concepts through a series of convolutional layers. The computer uses low-level features obtained\n",
    "at the initial levels to generate high-level features such as paws or eyes to identify the object. There are four layers in CNN:\n",
    "1. Convolutional Layer –\n",
    "2. Activation Layer (ReLU Layer) –\n",

    " pooling is a down-sampling operation that reduces the dimensionality of the\n",
    "  4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolution Operation\n",
    "First Layer:\n",
    "1. Input to a convolutional layer\n",
    "The image is resized to an optimal size and is fed as input to the convolutional layer. Let us consider the input as 32x32x3 array of pixel values.\n",
    "2. There exists a filter or neuron or kernel which lays over some of the pixels of the input image depending on the dimensions of the Kernel size.\n",
    "Let the dimensions of the kernel of the filter be 5x5x3.\n",
    "3. The Kernel actually slides over the input image; thus, it is multiplying the values in the filter with the original pixel values of the image (aka computing element-wise multiplications).\n",
    "The multiplications are summed up generating a single number for that particular receptive field and hence for sliding the kernel a total of 784 numbers are mapped to 28x28 array known as the feature map.\n",
    "**Now if we consider two kernels of the same dimension then the obtained first layer feature map will be (28x28x2).\n",
    "High-level Perspective\n",
    "   \n",
    "• Let us take a kernel of size (7x7x3) for understanding. Each of the kernels is considered to be a feature identifier, hence say that our filter will be a curve detector.\n",
    "• The original image and the visualization of the kernel on the image.\n",
    "The sum of the multiplication value that is generated is = 4 ∗ (50 ∗ 30) + (20 ∗ 30) = 6600 (large number).\n",
    "• Now when the kernel moves to the other part of the image.\n",
    "The sum of the multiplication value that is generated is = 0 (small number).\n",
    "The use of the small and the large value\n",
    "1. The value is much lower! This is because there wasn’t anything in the image section that responded to the curve detector filter. Remember, the output of this convolution layer is an activation map. So, in the simple case of a one filter convolution (and if that filter is a curve detector), the activation map will show the areas in which there at most likely to be curved in the picture.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. In the previous example, the top-left value of our 26 x 26 x 1 activation map (26 because of the 7x7 filter instead of 5x5) will be 6600. This high value means that it is likely that there is some sort of curve in the input volume that caused the filter to activate. The top right value in our activation map will be 0 because there wasn’t anything in the input volume that caused the filter to activate. This is just for one filter.\n",
    "In the picture, we can see some examples of actual visualizations of the filters of the first conv. layer of a trained network. Nonetheless, the main argument remains the same.\n",
    "Sequential convolutional layers after the first one\n",
    "1. When we go through another conv. layer, the output of the first conv. layer becomes the input of the 2nd conv. layer.\n",
    "2. However, when we’re talking about the 2nd conv. layer, the input is the activation map(s) that result from the first layer. So, each layer of the input is basically describing the locations in the original image for where certain low-level features appear.\n",
    "3. Now when you apply a set of filters on top of that (pass it through the 2nd conv. layer), the output will be activations that represent higher-level features. Types of these features could be semicircles (a combination of a curve and straight edge) or squares (a combination of several straight edges).\n",
    " 3. This is just a filter that is going to detect lines that curve outward and to the right. We can have\n",
    " other filters for lines that curve to the left or for straight edges. The more filters, the greater the\n",
    "depth of the activation map, and the more information we have about the input volume.\n",
    "  The filters on the\n",
    " first layer convolve around the input image and “activate” (or compute high values) when the\n",
    " specific feature it is looking for is in the input volume.\n",
    "  4.\n",
    "Pooling Operation\n",
    ".\n",
    "As you go through the network and go through more convolutional layers, you\n",
    " get activation maps that represent more and more complex features.\n",
    " By the end of the network, you may have some filters that activate when there is handwriting in\n",
    " the image, filters that activate when they see pink objects, etc\n",
    "\n",
    "It consists in getting the largest number out of a matrix to get the most important number and reduce the dimention.\n",
    "Max Pooling example\n",
    " Classification\n",
    "2x2 filters with stride = 2 (maximum value) is considered\n",
    "  3x3 filters with stride = 1 (maximum value) is considered\n",
    "  3x3 filters with stride = 2 (maximum value) is considered\n",
    "1. Flatten: The pooled matrix is converted to a vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Fully Connected layer: The way this fully connected layer works is that it looks at the output of the previous layer (which as we remember should represent the activation maps of high-level features) and the number of classes p (10 for digit classification). For example, if the program is predicting that some image is a dog, it will have high values in the activation maps that represent high-level features like a paw or 4 legs, etc. Basically,\n",
    "3. Soft-max approach: The output of a fully connected layer is as follows [0 .1 .1 .75 0 0 0 0 0 .05], then this represents a 10% probability that the image is a 1, a 10% probability that the image is a 2, a 75% probability that the image is a 3, and a 5% probability that the image is a 9 (SoftMax approach) for digit classification.\n",
    "Training\n",
    "§We know kernels also known as feature identifiers, used for identification of specific features. But how the kernels are initialized with the specific weights or how do the filters know what values to have.\n",
    "Hence comes the important step of training\n",
    "The Forward Pass\n",
    "For the first epoch or iteration of the training the initial kernels of the first convolutional layer are initialized with random values. Thus, after the first iteration output will be something like [.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1], which does not give preference to any class as the kernels don’t have specific weights.\n",
    "The Loss Function\n",
    "The training involves images along with labels, hence the label for the digit 3 will be [0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0], whereas the output after a first epoch is very different, hence we will calculate loss (MSE — Mean Squared Error)\n",
    "The objective is to minimize the loss, which is an optimization problem in calculus. It involves trying to adjust the weights to reduce the loss.\n",
    "The Backward Pass\n",
    " most strongly correlate to a particular class and has particular weights so that when you compute the products between the weights and the previous layer, you get the correct probabilities for the\n",
    "an FC layer looks at what high level features\n",
    "  different classes.\n",
    " . The training process is also known as backpropagation, which\n",
    " is further separated into 4 distinct sections or processes.\n",
    " • Forward Pass\n",
    " • Loss Function\n",
    " • Backward Pass\n",
    " • Weight Update\n",
    " \n",
    "It involves determining which weights contributed most to the loss and finding ways to adjust them so that the loss decreases.\n",
    "The weights update\n",
    "This is where the weights of the kernel are updated using the following equation.\n",
    "Here the Learning Rate is chosen by the programmer. Larger value of the learning rate indicates much larger steps towards optimization of steps and larger time to convolve to an optimized weight.\n",
    "Testing\n",
    "Finally, to see whether or not our CNN works, we have a different set of images and labels (can’t double dip between training and test!) and pass the images through the CNN. We compare the outputs to the ground truth and see if our network works!\n",
    "Q13. What Is Pooling on CNN, and How Does It Work?\n",
    "Pooling is used to reduce the spatial dimensions of a CNN. It performs down-sampling operations to reduce the dimensionality and creates a pooled feature map by sliding a filter matrix over the input matrix.\n",
    "Q14. What are Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)?\n",
    "https://towardsdatascience.com/recurrent-neural-networks-d4642c9bc7ce\n",
    "RNNs are a type of artificial neural networks designed to recognize the pattern from the sequence of data such as Time series, stock market and government agencies etc.\n",
    " It is computed using 􏰺􏱆 (or ∇􏰭􏱈), where L is the loss and the W is the weights of 􏰺􏱇\n",
    " the corresponding kernel.\n",
    "    Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) add an interesting twist to basic neural networks. A vanilla neural network takes in a fixed size vector as input which limits its usage in situations that involve a ‘series’ type\n",
    " input with no predetermined size.\n",
    "\n",
    "    RNNs are designed to take a series of input with no predetermined limit on size. One could ask what’s the big deal, I can call a regular NN repeatedly too?\n",
    "Sure can, but the ‘series’ part of the input means something. A single input item from the series is related to others and likely has an influence on its neighbors. Otherwise it's just “many” inputs, not a “series” input (duh!).\n",
    "Note: Basic feed forward networks “remember” things too, but they remember things they learnt during training. For example, an image classifier learns what a “1” looks like during training and then uses that knowledge to classify things in production.\n",
    "   Recurrent Neural Network remembers the past and its decisions are influenced by what it has learnt from\n",
    " the past.\n",
    " While RNNs learn similarly while training, in addition, they remember things learnt from prior input(s) while generating output(s). RNNs can take one or more input vectors and produce one or more output vectors and the output(s) are influenced not just by weights applied on inputs like a regular NN, but also\n",
    " by a “hidden” state vector representing the context based on prior input(s)/output(s).\n",
    "could produce a different output depending on previous inputs in the series.\n",
    "So, the same input\n",
    "\n",
    "    In summary, in a vanilla neural network, a fixed size input vector is transformed into a fixed size output vector. Such a network becomes “recurrent” when you repeatedly apply the transformations to a series of given input and produce a series of output vectors. There is no pre-set limitation to the size of the vector. And, in addition to generating the output which is a function of the input and hidden state, we\n",
    " update the hidden state itself based on the input and use it in processing the next input.\n",
    "Parameter Sharing\n",
    "You might have noticed another key difference between Figure 1 and Figure 3. In the earlier, multiple different weights are applied to the different parts of an input item generating a hidden layer neuron, which in turn is transformed using further weights to produce an output. There seems to be a lot of weights in play here. Whereas in Figure 3, we seem to be applying the same weights over and over again to different items in the input series.\n",
    "I am sure you are quick to point out that we are kind of comparing apples and oranges here. The first figure deals with “a” single input whereas the second figure represents multiple inputs from a series. But nevertheless, intuitively speaking, as the number of inputs increase, shouldn’t the number of weights in play increase as well? Are we losing some versatility and depth in Figure 3?\n",
    "Perhaps we are. We are sharing parameters across inputs in Figure 3. If we don’t share parameters across inputs, then it becomes like a vanilla neural network where each input node requires weights of their own. This introduces the constraint that the length of the input has to be fixed and that makes it impossible to leverage a series type input where the lengths differ and is not always known.\n",
    "But what we seemingly lose in value here, we gain back by introducing the “hidden state” that links one input to the next.\n",
    " The hidden state captures the relationship that neighbors might have with each other\n",
    " in a serial input and it keeps changing in every step, and thus effectively every input undergoes a different\n",
    " transition!\n",
    " Image classifying CNNs have become so successful because the 2D convolutions are an effective form of parameter sharing where each convolutional filter basically extracts the presence or absence of a feature\n",
    " in an image which is a function of not just one pixel but also of its surrounding neighbor pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    " In other words, the success of CNNs and RNNs can be attributed to the concept of “parameter sharing”\n",
    " which is fundamentally an effective way of leveraging the relationship between one input item and its\n",
    " surrounding neighbors in a more intrinsic fashion compared to a vanilla neural network.\n",
    "Deep RNNs\n",
    "While it’s good that the introduction of hidden state enabled us to effectively identify the relationship between the inputs, is there a way we can make an RNN “deep” and gain the multi-level abstractions and representations we gain through “depth” in a typical neural network?\n",
    "Here are four possible ways to add depth.\n",
    "Bidirectional RNNs\n",
    "Sometimes it’s not just about learning from the past to predict the future, but we also need to look into the future to fix the past. In speech recognition and handwriting recognition tasks, where there could be\n",
    "   1) We can add hidden states, one on top of another, feeding the output of one to the next.\n",
    "2) We can also add additional nonlinear hidden layers between input to hidden state.\n",
    "  3) We can increase depth in the hidden to hidden transition.\n",
    " 4) We can increase depth in the hidden to output transition.\n",
    " considerable ambiguity given just one part of the input, we often need to know what’s coming next to\n",

    "   This does introduce the obvious challenge of how much into the future we need to look into, because if\n",
    " And in cases like speech recognition, waiting till an entire sentence is spoken might make for a less compelling use case.

    "Recursive Neural Network\n",
    "Recursive Neural Networks are a more general form of Recurrent Neural Networks. It can operate on any hierarchical tree structure.\n",
    "we have to wait to see all inputs then the entire operation will become costly.\n",

    "  \n",
    "But this raises questions pertaining to the structure. How do we decide that? If the structure is fixed like in Recurrent Neural Networks then the process of training, backprop, makes sense in that they are similar to a regular neural network. But if the structure isn’t fixed, is that learnt as well?\n",

    "    In a vanilla RNN, the input and the hidden state are simply passed through a single tanh layer.

    "This chain-like nature reveals that recurrent neural networks are intimately related to sequences and lists. They’re the natural architecture of neural network to use for such data.\n",
    "And they certainly are used! In the last few years, there have been incredible success applying RNNs to a variety of problems: speech recognition, language modeling, translation, image captioning...\n",
    "Essential to these successes is the use of “LSTMs,” a very special kind of recurrent neural network which works, for many tasks, much better than the standard version. Almost all exciting results based on recurrent neural networks are achieved with them.\n",
    "The Problem of Long-Term Dependencies\n",
    "One of the appeals of RNNs is the idea that they might be able to connect previous information to the present task, such as using previous video frames might inform the understanding of the present frame. If RNNs could do this, they’d be extremely useful. But can they? It depends.\n",
    "Sometimes, we only need to look at recent information to perform the present task. For example, consider a language model trying to predict the next word based on the previous ones. If we are trying to predict the last word in “the clouds are in the sky,” we don’t need any further context – it’s pretty obvious the next word is going to be sky. In such cases, where the gap between the relevant information and the place that it’s needed is small, RNNs can learn to use the past information.\n",
    "But there are also cases where we need more context. Consider trying to predict the last word in the text “I grew up in France... I speak fluent French.” Recent information suggests that the next word is probably the name of a language, but if we want to narrow down which language, we need the context of France, from further back. It’s entirely possible for the gap between the relevant information and the point where it is needed to become very large.\n",
    "Unfortunately, as that gap grows, RNNs become unable to learn to connect the information.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  In theory, RNNs are absolutely capable of handling such “long-term dependencies.” A human could carefully pick parameters for them to solve toy problems of this form. Sadly, in practice, RNNs don’t seem to be able to learn them. Thankfully, LSTMs don’t have this problem!\n",
    "LSTM Networks\n",
    "Long Short-Term Memory networks – usually just called “LSTMs” – are a special kind of RNN, capable of learning long-term dependencies. They work tremendously well on a large variety of problems and are now widely used.\n",
    "All recurrent neural networks have the form of a chain of repeating modules of neural network. In standard RNNs, this repeating module will have a very simple structure, such as a single tanh layer.\n",
    "The repeating module in a standard RNN contains a single layer.\n",
    " LSTMs are explicitly designed to avoid the long-term dependency problem. Remembering information for\n",
    " long periods of time is practically their default behavior, not something they struggle to learn!\n",
    "   LSTMs also have this chain like structure, but the repeating module has a different structure. Instead of\n",
    " having a single neural network layer, there are four, interacting in a very special way.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The repeating module in an LSTM contains four interacting layers.\n",
    "In the above diagram, each line carries an entire vector, from the output of one node to the inputs of others. The pink circles represent pointwise operations, like vector addition, while the yellow boxes are learned neural network layers. Lines merging denote concatenation, while a line forking denotes its content being copied and the copies going to different locations.\n",
    "The Core Idea Behind LSTMs\n",
    "The key to LSTMs is the cell state, the horizontal line running through the top of the diagram.\n",
    "The cell state is kind of like a conveyor belt. It runs straight down the entire chain, with only some minor linear interactions. It’s very easy for information to just flow along it unchanged.\n",
    "     The LSTM does have the ability to remove or add information to the cell state, carefully regulated by\n",
    " structures called gates.\n",
    " Gates are a way to optionally let information through. They are composed out of a sigmoid neural net\n",
    " layer and a pointwise multiplication operation.\n",
    "\n",
    " The sigmoid layer outputs numbers between zero and one, describing how much of each component should be let through. A value of zero means “let nothing through,” while a value of one means “let everything through!”\n",
    "An LSTM has three of these gates, to protect and control the cell state.\n",

    "Perceptron is a single layer neural network and a multi-layer perceptron is called Neural Networks.\n",
    "A (single layer) perceptron is a single layer neural network that works as a linear binary classifier. Being a single layer neural network, it can be trained without the use of more advanced algorithms like back propagation and instead can be trained by \"stepping towards\" your error in steps specified by a learning rate. When someone says perceptron, I usually think of the single layer version.\n",

    "  A single layer perceptron can classify only linear separable classes with binary output {0,1} or {-1,1}, but\n",
    " MLP can classify nonlinear classes.\n",

    "The activation functions are used to map the input between the\n",
    "  Except for the input layer, each node in the other layers uses a nonlinear activation function. This means the input layers, the data coming in, and the activation function is based upon all nodes and weights being added together, producing the output.\n",
    "Usually, RELU is in hidden layers (it does not classify), and Soft-max or tanh is in output layers.\n",
    "Q17. Explain Gradient Descent.\n",
    "Let’s first explain what a gradient is. A gradient is a mathematical function. When calculated on a point of a function, it gives the hyperplane (or slope) of the directions in which the function increases more. The gradient vector can be interpreted as the \"direction and rate of fastest increase\". If the gradient of a\n",
    " MLP uses a supervised learning method called “backpropagation.”\n",
    " In backpropagation, the neural network calculates the error with the help of cost function. It propagates\n",
    " this error backward from where it came (adjusts the weights to train the model more accurately).\n",
    " \n",
    "function is non-zero at a point p, the direction of the gradient is the direction in which the function increases most quickly from p, and the magnitude of the gradient is the rate of increase in that direction.\n",
    "Gradient descent is a first-order iterative optimization algorithm for finding the minimum of a function.\n",
    "So, the idea is to pass the training set through the hidden layers of the neural network and then update the parameters of the layers by computing the gradients using the training samples from the training dataset.\n",
    "Think of it like this. Suppose a man is at top of the valley and he wants to get to the bottom of the valley. So, he goes down the slope. He decides his next position based on his current position and stops when he gets to the bottom of the valley which was his goal.\n",
    "Q18. What is exploding gradients?\n",
    "https://machinelearningmastery.com/exploding-gradients-in-neural-networks/\n",
    "While training an RNN, if you see exponentially growing (very large) error gradients which accumulate and result in very large updates to neural network model weights during training, they’re known as exploding gradients. At an extreme, the values of weights can become so large as to overflow and result in NaN values.\n",
    "This has the effect of your model is unstable and unable to learn from your training data.\n",
    "  Further, the gradient is the zero vector at a point if and only if it is a stationary point (where the derivative\n",

    " In DS, it simply measures the change in all weights with regard to the change in error, as we are partially\n",

    "   The goal of the gradient descent is to minimize a given function which, in our case, is the loss function of\n",

    "There are some subtle signs that you may be suffering from exploding gradients during the training of your network, such as:\n",
    "• The model is unable to get traction on your training data (e.g. poor loss).\n",
    "• The model is unstable, resulting in large changes in loss from update to update.\n",
    "Solutions\n",
    "1. Re-Design the Network Model:\n",
    "a. In deep neural networks, exploding gradients may be addressed by redesigning the\n",

    "2. Use Long Short-Term Memory Networks: In RNNs, exploding gradients can be reduced by using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) memory units and perhaps related gated-type neuron structures. Adopting LSTM memory units is a new best practice for recurrent neural networks for sequence prediction.\n",
    "3. Use Gradient Clipping: Exploding gradients can still occur in very deep Multilayer Perceptron networks with a large batch size and LSTMs with very long input sequence lengths. If exploding gradients are still occurring, you can check for and limit the size of gradients during the training of your network. This is called\n",
    "4. Use Weight Regularization: another approach, if exploding gradients are still occurring, is to check the size of network weights and apply a penalty to the networks loss function for large weight values. This is called weight regularization and often an L1 (absolute weights) or an L2 (squared weights) penalty can be used.\n",
    "Q19. What is vanishing gradients?\n",
    "While training an RNN, your slope can become either too small; this makes the training difficult. When the slope is too small, the problem is known as a Vanishing Gradient. It leads to long training times, poor performance, and low accuracy.\n",

    "• Stochastic Gradient Descent: In Batch Gradient Descent we were considering all the examples for every step of Gradient Descent. But what if our dataset is very huge. Deep learning models crave for data. The more the data the more chances of a model to be good. Suppose our dataset has 5 million examples, then just to take one step the model will have to calculate the gradients of all the 5 million examples. This does not seem an efficient way. To tackle this problem, we have Stochastic Gradient Descent. In Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), we consider just one example at a time to take a single step. We do the following steps in one epoch for SGD:\n",
    "1. Take an example\n",
    "2. Feed it to Neural Network\n",
    "3. Calculate its gradient\n",
    "4. Use the gradient we calculated in step 3 to update the weights\n",
    "5. Repeat steps 1–4 for all the examples in training dataset\n",
    "Since we are considering just one example at a time the cost will fluctuate over the training examples and it will not necessarily decrease. But in the long run, you will see the cost decreasing with fluctuations. Also, because the cost is so fluctuating, it will never reach the minimum, but it will keep dancing around it. SGD can be used for larger datasets. It converges faster when the dataset is large as it causes updates to the parameters more frequently.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  • Batch Gradient Descent: all the training data is taken into consideration to take a single step. We take the average of the gradients of all the training examples and then use that mean gradient to update our parameters. So that’s just one step of gradient descent in one epoch. Batch Gradient Descent is great for convex or relatively smooth error manifolds. In this case, we move somewhat directly towards an optimum solution. The graph of cost vs epochs is also quite smooth because we are averaging over all the gradients of training data for a single step. The cost keeps on decreasing over the epochs.\n",
    "• Mini-batch Gradient Descent: It’s one of the most popular optimization algorithms. It’s a variant of Stochastic Gradient Descent and here instead of single training example, mini batch of samples is used.\n",

    "This reduction helps in compressing data and reducing storage space. It also reduces computation time as fewer dimensions lead to less computing. It removes redundant features; for example, there's no point in storing a value in two different units (meters and inches).\n",

    "Q10. How should you maintain a deployed model?\n",
    "The steps to maintain a deployed model are (CREM):\n",
    "1. Monitor: constant monitoring of all models is needed to determine their performance accuracy. When you change something, you want to figure out how your changes are going to affect things. This needs to be monitored to ensure it's doing what it's supposed to do.\n",
    "2. Evaluate: evaluation metrics of the current model are calculated to determine if a new algorithm\n",
    "3. Compare: the new models are compared to each other to determine which model performs the best.\n",
    "4. Rebuild: the best performing model is re-built on the current state of data.\n",

    "Q12. 'People who bought this also bought...' recommendations seen on Amazon are a result of which algorithm?\n",
    "The recommendation engine is accomplished with collaborative filtering. Collaborative filtering explains the behavior of other users and their purchase history in terms of ratings, selection, etc.\n",
    "The engine makes predictions on what might interest a person based on the preferences of other users.\n",
    "In this algorithm, item features are unknown.\n",
    "For example, a sales page shows that a certain number of people buy a new phone and also buy tempered glass at the same time. Next time, when a person buys a phone, he or she may see a recommendation to buy tempered glass as well.\n",
    "Q13. What is a Generative Adversarial Network?\n",
    "Suppose there is a wine shop purchasing wine from dealers, which they resell later. But some dealers sell fake wine. In this case, the shop owner should be able to distinguish between fake and authentic wine. The forger will try different techniques to sell fake wine and make sure specific techniques go past the shop owner’s check. The shop owner would probably get some feedback from wine experts that some of the wine is not original. The owner would have to improve how he determines whether a wine is fake or authentic.\n",
    "The forger’s goal is to create wines that are indistinguishable from the authentic ones while the shop owner intends to tell if the wine is real or not accurately.\n",
    "• There is a noise vector coming into the forger who is generating fake wine.\n",
    "• Here the forger acts as a Generator.\n",
    "• The shop owner acts as a Discriminator.\n",
    "• The Discriminator gets two inputs; one is the fake wine, while the other is the real authentic wine.\n",
    "The shop owner has to figure out whether it is real or fake.\n",
    "So, there are two primary components of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) named:\n",
    "1. Generator\n",
    "2. Discriminator\n",
    "  \n",
    " The generator is a CNN that keeps keys producing images and is closer in appearance to the real images while the discriminator tries to determine the difference between real and fake images. The ultimate aim\n",
    " is to make the discriminator learn to identify real and fake images.\n",
    "Q14. You are given a dataset on cancer detection. You have built a classification model and achieved an accuracy of 96 percent. Why shouldn't you be happy with your model performance? What can you do about it?\n",
    "Cancer detection results in imbalanced data. In an imbalanced dataset, accuracy should not be based as a measure of performance. It is important to focus on the remaining four percent, which represents the patients who were wrongly diagnosed. Early diagnosis is crucial when it comes to cancer detection and can greatly improve a patient's prognosis.\n",

You have been asked to determine if offering a coupon to website visitors has any impact on their purchase decisions. Which analysis method should you use?\n",
    "One-way ANOVA: in statistics, one-way analysis of variance is a technique that can be used to compare means of two or more samples. This technique can be used only for numerical response data, the \"Y\", usually one variable, and numerical or categorical input data, the \"X\", always one variable, hence \"one- way\".\n",
    "The ANOVA tests the null hypothesis, which states that samples in all groups are drawn from populations with the same mean values. To do this, two estimates are made of the population variance. The ANOVA produces an F-statistic, the ratio of the variance calculated among the means to the variance within the samples. If the group means are drawn from populations with the same mean values, the variance between the group means should be lower than the variance of the samples, following the central limit theorem. A higher ratio therefore implies that the samples were drawn from populations with different mean values.\n",

    "    Q24. What is a Canary Deployment?\n",
    "https://www.split.io/glossary/canary-deployment/\n",
    "A canary deployment, or canary release, allows you to rollout your features to only a subset of users as an initial test to make sure nothing else in your system broke.\n",
    "The initial steps for implementing canary deployment are:\n",
    "1. create two clones of the production environment,\n",
    "2. have a load balancer that initially sends all traffic to one version,\n",
    "3. create new functionality in the other version.\n",
    "When you deploy the new software version, you shift some percentage – say, 10% – of your user base to the new version while maintaining 90% of users on the old version. If that 10% reports no errors, you can roll it out to gradually more users, until the new version is being used by everyone. If the 10% has problems, though, you can roll it right back, and 90% of your users will have never even seen the problem.\n",
    "Canary deployment benefits include zero downtime, easy rollout and quick rollback – plus the added safety from the gradual rollout process. It also has some drawbacks – the expense of maintaining multiple server instances, the difficult clone-or-don’t-clone database decision.\n",
    " \n",
    "Typically, software development teams implement blue/green deployment when they’re sure the new version will work properly and want a simple, fast strategy to deploy it. Conversely, canary deployment is most useful when the development team isn’t as sure about the new version and they don’t mind a slower rollout if it means they’ll be able to catch the bugs.\n",
    "Q25. What is a Blue Green Deployment?\n",
    "https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/blue-green.html\n",
    "Blue-green deployment is a technique that reduces downtime and risk by running two identical production environments called Blue and Green.\n",
    "At any time, only one of the environments is live, with the live environment serving all production traffic. For this example, Blue is currently live, and Green is idle.\n",
    "As you prepare a new version of your model, deployment and the final stage of testing takes place in the environment that is not live: in this example, Green. Once you have deployed and fully tested the model in Green, you switch the router, so all incoming requests now go to Green instead of Blue. Green is now live, and Blue is idle.\n",
    "This technique can eliminate downtime due to app deployment and reduces risk: if something unexpected happens with your new version on Green, you can immediately roll back to the last version by switching back to Blue.\n",

    " Top 100 Machine Learning Questions & Answers\n",
    "Steve Nouri\n",
    "Q1 Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning?\n",
    "In supervised machine learning algorithms, we have to provide labeled data, for example, prediction of stock market prices, whereas in unsupervised we need not have labeled data, for example, classification of emails into spam and non-spam.\n",
    "Q2 What are the parametric models? Give an example.\n",
    "Parametric models are those with a finite number of parameters. To predict new data, you only need to know the parameters of the model. Examples include linear regression, logistic regression, and linear SVMs.\n",
    "Non-parametric models are those with an unbounded number of parameters, allowing for more flexibility. To predict new data, you need to know the parameters of the model and the state of the data that has been observed. Examples include decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, and topic models using latent Dirichlet analysis.\n",
    "Q3 What is the difference between classification and regression?\n",
    "Classification is used to produce discrete results, classification is used to classify data into some specific categories. For example, classifying emails into spam and non-spam categories. Whereas, We use regression analysis when we are dealing with continuous data, for example predicting stock prices at a certain point in time.\n",
    "Q4 What Is Overfitting, and How Can You Avoid It?\n",
    "Overfitting is a situation that occurs when a model learns the training set too well, taking up random fluctuations in the training data as concepts. These impact the model’s ability to generalize and don’t apply to new data.\n",
    "When a model is given the training data, it shows 100 percent accuracy—technically a slight loss. But, when we use the test data, there may be an error and low efficiency. This condition is known as overfitting.\n",
    "There are multiple ways of avoiding overfitting, such as:\n",
    "● Regularization. It involves a cost term for the features involved with the objective function\n",
    "● Making a simple model. With lesser variables and parameters, the variance can be\n",
    "reduced\n",
    "● Cross-validation methods like k-folds can also be used\n",
    "● If some model parameters are likely to cause overfitting, techniques for regularization\n",
    "like LASSO can be used that penalize these parameters\n",
    "    Steve Nouri ​ ​https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenouri/\n",
    "\n",
    " Q5 What is meant by ‘Training set’ and ‘Test Set’?\n",
    "We split the given data set into two different sections namely,’Training set’ and ‘Test Set’. ‘Training set’ is the portion of the dataset used to train the model.\n",
    "‘Testing set’ is the portion of the dataset used to test the trained model.\n",
    "Q6 How Do You Handle Missing or Corrupted Data in a Dataset?\n",
    "One of the easiest ways to handle missing or corrupted data is to drop those rows or columns or replace them entirely with some other value.\n",
    "There are two useful methods in Pandas:\n",
    "● IsNull() and dropna() will help to find the columns/rows with missing data and drop them\n",
    "● Fillna() will replace the wrong values with a placeholder value\n",
    "Q7 Explain Ensemble learning.\n",
    "In ensemble learning, many base models like classifiers and regressors are generated and combined together so that they give better results. It is used when we build component classifiers that are accurate and independent. There are sequential as well as parallel ensemble methods.\n",
    "Q8 Explain the Bias-Variance Tradeoff.\n",
    "Predictive models have a tradeoff between bias (how well the model fits the data) and variance (how much the model changes based on changes in the inputs).\n",
    "Simpler models are stable (low variance) but they don't get close to the truth (high bias).\n",
    "More complex models are more prone to overfitting (high variance) but they are expressive enough to get close to the truth (low bias). The best model for a given problem usually lies somewhere in the middle.\n",
    "Q9 What is the difference between stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and\n",
    "gradient descent (GD)?\n",
    "Both algorithms are methods for finding a set of parameters that minimize a loss function by evaluating parameters against data and then making adjustments.\n",
    "In standard gradient descent, you'll evaluate all training samples for each set of parameters. This is akin to taking big, slow steps toward the solution.\n",
    "In stochastic gradient descent, you'll evaluate only 1 training sample for the set of parameters before updating them. This is akin to taking small, quick steps toward the solution.\n",
    "Q10 How Can You Choose a Classifier Based on a Training Set Data Size?\n",
    "When the training set is small, a model that has a right bias and low variance seems to work better because they are less likely to overfit.\n",
    "Steve Nouri ​ ​https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenouri/\n",
    " \n",
    " For example, Naive Bayes works best when the training set is large. Models with low bias and high variance tend to perform better as they work fine with complex relationships.\n",
    "Q11 What are 3 data preprocessing techniques to handle outliers?\n",
    "1. Winsorize (cap at threshold).\n",
    "2. Transform to reduce skew (using Box-Cox or similar).\n",
    "3. Remove outliers if you're certain they are anomalies or measurement errors.\n",
    "Q12 How much data should you allocate for your training, validation, and test sets?\n",
    "You have to find a balance, and there's no right answer for every problem.\n",
    "If your test set is too small, you'll have an unreliable estimation of model performance (performance statistic will have high variance). If your training set is too small, your actual model parameters will have a high variance.\n",
    "A good rule of thumb is to use an 80/20 train/test split. Then, your train set can be further split into train/validation or into partitions for cross-validation.\n",
    "Q13 What Is a False Positive and False Negative and How Are They Significant?\n",
    "False positives are those cases which wrongly get classified as True but are False.\n",
    "False negatives are those cases which wrongly get classified as False but are True.\n",
    "In the term ‘False Positive,’ the word ‘Positive’ refers to the ‘Yes’ row of the predicted value in the confusion matrix. The complete term indicates that the system has predicted it as a positive, but the actual value is negative.\n",
    "Q14 Explain the difference between L1 and L2 regularization.\n",
    "L2 regularization tends to spread error among all the terms, while L1 is more binary/sparse, with many variables either being assigned a 1 or 0 in weighting. L1 corresponds to setting a Laplacean prior to the terms, while L2 corresponds to a Gaussian prior.\n",
    "Q15 What’s a Fourier transform?\n",
    "A Fourier transform is a generic method to decompose generic functions into a superposition of symmetric functions. Or as this more intuitive tutorial puts it, given a smoothie, it’s how we find the recipe. The Fourier transform finds the set of cycle speeds, amplitudes, and phases to match any time signal. A Fourier transform converts a signal from time to frequency domain — it’s a very common way to extract features from audio signals or other time series such as sensor data.\n",
    "Q16 What is deep learning, and how does it contrast with other machine learning algorithms?\n",
    "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that is concerned with neural networks: how to use backpropagation and certain principles from neuroscience to more accurately model large sets of unlabelled or semi-structured data. In that sense, deep learning represents an\n",
    "Steve Nouri ​ ​https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenouri/\n",
    " \n",
    " unsupervised learning algorithm that learns representations of data through the use of neural nets.\n",
    "Q17 What’s the difference between a generative and discriminative model?\n",
    "A generative model will learn categories of data while a discriminative model will simply learn the distinction between different categories of data. Discriminative models will generally outperform generative models on classification tasks.\n",
    "Q18 What Are the Applications of Supervised Machine Learning in Modern Businesses?\n",
    "Applications of supervised machine learning include:\n",
    "● Email Spam Detection\n",
    "Here we train the model using historical data that consists of emails categorized as\n",
    "spam or not spam. This labeled information is fed as input to the model.\n",
    "● Healthcare Diagnosis\n",
    "By providing images regarding a disease, a model can be trained to detect if a person is suffering from the disease or not.\n",
    "● Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "This refers to the process of using algorithms to mine documents and determine\n",
    "whether they’re positive, neutral, or negative in sentiment.\n",
    "● Fraud Detection\n",
    "Training the model to identify suspicious patterns, we can detect instances of possible fraud.\n",
    "Q19 What Is Semi-supervised Machine Learning?\n",
    "Supervised learning uses data that is completely labeled, whereas unsupervised learning uses no training data.\n",
    "In the case of semi-supervised learning, the training data contains a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data.\n",
    "Q20. What Are Unsupervised Machine Learning Techniques?\n",
    "There are two techniques used in unsupervised learning: clustering and association.\n",
    "Clustering\n",
    "● Clustering problems involve data to be divided into subsets. These subsets, also called clusters, contain data that are similar to each other. Different clusters reveal different details about the objects, unlike classification or regression.\n",
    "Association\n",
    "● In an association problem, we identify patterns of associations between different variables or items.\n",
    "● For example, an eCommerce website can suggest other items for you to buy, based on the prior purchases that you have made, spending habits, items in your wishlist, other customers’ purchase habits, and so on.\n",
    "Steve Nouri ​ ​https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenouri/\n",
    " \n",
    " Q21 What Is ‘naive’ in the Naive Bayes Classifier?\n",
    "The classifier is called ‘naive’ because it makes assumptions that may or may not turn out to be correct.\n",
    "The algorithm assumes that the presence of one feature of a class is not related to the presence of any other feature (absolute independence of features), given the class variable.\n",
    "For instance, a fruit may be considered to be a cherry if it is red in color and round in shape, regardless of other features. This assumption may or may not be right (as an apple also matches the description).\n",
    "Q22 Explain Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).\n",
    "Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a common method of topic modeling, or classifying documents by subject matter.\n",
    "LDA is a generative model that represents documents as a mixture of topics that each have their own probability distribution of possible words.\n",
    "The \"Dirichlet\" distribution is simply a distribution of distributions. In LDA, documents are distributions of topics that are distributions of words.\n",
    "Q23 Explain Principle Component Analysis (PCA).\n",
    "PCA is a method for transforming features in a dataset by combining them into uncorrelated linear combinations.\n",
    "These new features, or principal components, sequentially maximize the variance represented (i.e. the first principal component has the most variance, the second principal component has the second most, and so on).\n",
    "As a result, PCA is useful for dimensionality reduction because you can set an arbitrary variance cutoff.\n",
    "Q24 What’s the F1 score? How would you use it?\n",
    "The F1 score is a measure of a model’s performance. It is a weighted average of the precision and recall of a model, with results tending to 1 being the best, and those tending to 0 being the worst. You would use it in classification tests where true negatives don’t matter much.\n",
    "Steve Nouri ​ ​https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenouri/\n",
    " \n",
    " Q25 When should you use classification over regression?\n",
    "Classification produces discrete values and dataset to strict categories, while regression gives you continuous results that allow you to better distinguish differences between individual points. You would use classification over regression if you wanted your results to reflect the belongingness of data points in your dataset to certain explicit categories (ex: If you wanted to know whether a name was male or female rather than just how correlated they were with male and female names.)\n",
    "Q26 How do you ensure you’re not overfitting with a model?\n",
    "This is a simple restatement of a fundamental problem in machine learning: the possibility of overfitting training data and carrying the noise of that data through to the test set, thereby providing inaccurate generalizations.\n",
    "There are three main methods to avoid overfitting:\n",
    "1- Keep the model simpler: reduce variance by taking into account fewer variables and parameters, thereby removing some of the noise in the training data.\n",
    "2- Use cross-validation techniques such as k-folds cross-validation.\n",
    "3- Use regularization techniques such as LASSO that penalize certain model parameters if they’re likely to cause overfitting.\n",
    "Q27 How Will You Know Which Machine Learning Algorithm to Choose for Your Classification Problem?\n",
    "While there is no fixed rule to choose an algorithm for a classification problem, you can follow these guidelines:\n",
    "● If accuracy is a concern, test different algorithms and cross-validate them\n",
    "● If the training dataset is small, use models that have low variance and high bias\n",
    "● If the training dataset is large, use models that have high variance and little bias\n",
    "Q28 How Do You Design an Email Spam Filter?\n",
    "Building a spam filter involves the following process:\n",
    "● The email spam filter will be fed with thousands of emails\n",
    "● Each of these emails already has a label: ‘spam’ or ‘not spam.’\n",
    "● The supervised machine learning algorithm will then determine which type of emails are\n",
    "being marked as spam based on spam words like the lottery, free offer, no money, full\n",
    "refund, etc.\n",
    "● The next time an email is about to hit your inbox, the spam filter will use statistical\n",
    "analysis and algorithms like Decision Trees and SVM to determine how likely the email\n",
    "is spam\n",
    "● If the likelihood is high, it will label it as spam, and the email won’t hit your inbox\n",
    "Steve Nouri ​ ​https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenouri/\n",
    " \n",

    "Q29 What evaluation approaches would you work to gauge the effectiveness of a machine learning model?\n",
    "You would first split the dataset into training and test sets, or perhaps use cross-validation techniques to further segment the dataset into composite sets of training and test sets within the data. You should then implement a choice selection of performance metrics: here is a fairly comprehensive list. You could use measures such as the F1 score, the accuracy, and the confusion matrix. What’s important here is to demonstrate that you understand the nuances of how a model is measured and how to choose the right performance measures for the right situations.\n",
    "Q30 How would you implement a recommendation system for our company’s users?\n",
    "A lot of machine learning interview questions of this type will involve the implementation of machine learning models to a company’s problems.

    "Bagging is performed in parallel.\n",
    "Q32 What is the ROC Curve and what is AUC (a.k.a. AUROC)?\n",
    "The ROC (receiver operating characteristic) the performance plot for binary classifiers of True Positive Rate (y-axis) vs. False Positive Rate (x-\n",
    "axis).\n",
    "AUC is the area under the ROC curve, and it's a common performance metric for evaluating binary classification models.\n",

    "AUROC is robust to class imbalance, unlike raw accuracy.\n",
    "For example, if you want to detect a type of cancer that's prevalent in only 1% of the population, you can build a model that achieves 99% accuracy by simply classifying everyone has cancer-free.\n",
    "Q34 What are the advantages and disadvantages of neural networks?\n",
    "Advantages: Neural networks (specifically deep NNs) have led to performance breakthroughs for unstructured datasets such as images, audio, and video. Their incredible flexibility allows them to learn patterns that no other ML algorithm can learn.\n",
    "Disadvantages: However, they require a large amount of training data to converge. It's also difficult to pick the right architecture, and the internal \"hidden\" layers are incomprehensible.\n",

    "Q36 What Is Decision Tree Classification?\n",
    "A decision tree builds classification (or regression) models as a tree structure, with datasets broken up into ever-smaller subsets while developing the decision tree, literally in a tree-like way with branches and nodes. Decision trees can handle both categorical and numerical data.\n",
    "Q37 What Is Pruning in Decision Trees, and How Is It Done?\n",
    "Pruning is a technique in machine learning that reduces the size of decision trees. It reduces the complexity of the final classifier, and hence improves predictive accuracy by the reduction of overfitting.\n",
    "Pruning can occur in:\n",
    "● Top-down fashion. It will traverse nodes and trim subtrees starting at the root\n",

    "Q42 How is KNN different from k-means clustering?\n",
    "K-Nearest Neighbors is a supervised classification algorithm, while k-means clustering is an unsupervised clustering algorithm. While the mechanisms may seem similar at first, what this really means is that in order for K-Nearest Neighbors to work, you need labeled data you want to classify an unlabeled point into (thus the nearest neighbor part). K-means clustering requires only a set of unlabeled points and a threshold: the algorithm will take unlabeled points and gradually learn how to cluster them into groups by computing the mean of the distance between different points.\n",
    "Q43 Mention the difference between Data Mining and Machine learning?\n",
    "Machine learning relates to the study, design, and development of the algorithms that give computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

    "Q45 You are given a data set. The data set has missing values that spread along 1 standard deviation from the median. What percentage of data would remain unaffected? Why?\n",
    "This question has enough hints for you to start thinking! Since the data is spread across the median, let’s assume it’s a normal distribution. We know, in a normal distribution, ~68% of the data lies in 1 standard deviation from mean (or mode, median), which leaves ~32% of the data unaffected. Therefore, ~32% of the data would remain unaffected by missing values.\n",
    "Q46 What are PCA, KPCA, and ICA used for?\n",
    "PCA (Principal Components Analysis), KPCA ( Kernel-based Principal Component Analysis) and ICA ( Independent Component Analysis) are important feature extraction techniques used for dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "Q47 What are support vector machines?\n",
    "Support vector machines are supervised learning algorithms used for classification and regression analysis.\n",

These techniques provide guarantees on the performance of the learned predictor on the future unseen data based on a statistical assumption on the data generating process.\n",
    "Q49 What is the bias-variance decomposition of classification error in the ensemble method?\n",
    "The expected error of a learning algorithm can be decomposed into bias and variance. A bias term measures how closely the average classifier produced by the learning algorithm matches the target function. The variance term measures how much the learning algorithm’s prediction fluctuates for different training sets.\n",

    " Q50 When is Ridge regression favorable over Lasso regression?\n",
    "You can quote ISLR’s authors Hastie, Tibshirani who asserted that, in the presence of few variables with medium / large sized effect, use lasso regression. In presence of many variables with small/medium-sized effects, use ridge regression.\n",
    "Conceptually, we can say, lasso regression (L1) does both variable selection and parameter shrinkage, whereas Ridge regression only does parameter shrinkage and end up including all the coefficients in the model. In the presence of correlated variables, ridge regression might be the preferred choice. Also, ridge regression works best in situations where the least square estimates have higher variance. Therefore, it depends on our model objective.\n",
    "Q51 You’ve built a random forest model with 10000 trees. You got delighted after getting training error as 0.00. But, the validation error is 34.23. What is going on? Haven’t you trained your model perfectly?\n",
    "The model has overfitted. Training error 0.00 means the classifier has mimicked the training data patterns to an extent, that they are not available in the unseen data. Hence, when this classifier was run on an unseen sample, it couldn’t find those patterns and returned predictions with higher error. In a random forest, it happens when we use a larger number of trees than necessary. Hence, to avoid this situation, we should tune the number of trees using cross-validation.\n",
    "Q50 What is a convex hull?\n",
    "In the case of linearly separable data, the convex hull represents the outer boundaries of the two groups of data points. Once the convex hull is created, we get maximum margin hyperplane (MMH) as a perpendicular bisector between two convex hulls. MMH is the line which attempts to create the greatest separation between two groups.\n",
    "Q51 What do you understand by Type I vs Type II error?\n",
    "Type I error is committed when the null hypothesis is true and we reject it, also known as a ‘False Positive’. Type II error is committed when the null hypothesis is false and we accept it, also known as ‘False Negative’.\n",
    "In the context of the confusion matrix, we can say Type I error occurs when we classify a value as positive (1) when it is actually negative (0). Type II error occurs when we classify a value as negative (0) when it is actually positive(1).\n",
    "Q52. In k-means or kNN, we use euclidean distance to calculate the distance between nearest neighbors. Why not manhattan distance?\n",
    "We don’t use manhattan distance because it calculates distance horizontally or vertically only. It has dimension restrictions. On the other hand, the euclidean metric can be used in any space to calculate distance. Since the data points can be present in any dimension, euclidean distance is a more viable option.\n",

    "Q53 Do you suggest that treating a categorical variable as a continuous variable would result in a better predictive model?\n",
    "For better predictions, the categorical variable can be considered as a continuous variable only when the variable is ordinal in nature.\n",
    "Q54 OLS is to linear regression. The maximum likelihood is logistic regression. Explain the statement.\n",
    "OLS and Maximum likelihood are the methods used by the respective regression methods to approximate the unknown parameter (coefficient) value. In simple words,\n",
    "Ordinary least square(OLS) is a method used in linear regression which approximates the parameters resulting in minimum distance between actual and predicted values. Maximum Likelihood helps in choosing the values of parameters which maximizes the likelihood that the parameters are most likely to produce observed data.\n",
    "Q55 When does regularization becomes necessary in Machine Learning?\n",
    "Regularization becomes necessary when the model begins to overfit/underfit. This technique introduces a cost term for bringing in more features with the objective function. Hence, it tries to push the coefficients for many variables to zero and hence reduce the cost term. This helps to reduce model complexity so that the model can become better at predicting (generalizing).\n",
    "Q56 What is Linear Regression?\n",
    "Linear Regression is a supervised Machine Learning algorithm. It is used to find the linear relationship between the dependent and the independent variables for predictive analysis.\n",
    "Q57 What is the Variance Inflation Factor?\n",
    "Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) is the estimate of the volume of multicollinearity in a collection of many regression variables.\n",
    "VIF = Variance of the model / Variance of the model with a single independent variable\n",
    "We have to calculate this ratio for every independent variable. If VIF is high, then it shows the high collinearity of the independent variables.\n",
    "Q58 We know that one hot encoding increases the dimensionality of a dataset, but label encoding doesn’t. How?\n",
    "When we use ​one-hot encoding, there is an increase in the dimensionality of a dataset. The reason for the increase in dimensionality is that, for every class in the categorical variables, it forms a different variable.\n",

    "In most of the Machine Learning Interviews, apart from theoretical questions, interviewers focus on the implementation part. So, this ML Interview Questions focused on the implementation of the theoretical concepts.\n",
    "Converting data into binary values on the basis of threshold values is known as the binarizing of data. The values that are less than the threshold are set to 0 and the values that are greater than the threshold are set to 1. This process is useful when we have to perform feature engineering, and we can also use it for adding unique features.\n",
    "Q61 What is cross-validation?\n",
    "Cross-validation is essentially a technique used to assess how well a model performs on a new independent dataset. The simplest example of cross-validation is when you split your data into two groups: training data and testing data, where you use the training data to build the model and the testing data to test the model.\n",
    "Q62 When would you use random forests Vs SVM and why?\n",
    "There are a couple of reasons why a random forest is a better choice of the model than a support vector machine:\n",
    "● Random forests allow you to determine the feature importance. SVM’s can’t do this.\n",
    "● Random forests are much quicker and simpler to build than an SVM.\n",

    "Another way of asking this question is “Is a random forest a better model than a decision tree?” And the answer is yes because a random forest is an ensemble method that takes many weak decision trees to make a strong learner. Random forests are more accurate, more robust, and less prone to overfitting.\n",
    "Q65 What is a kernel? Explain the kernel trick\n",
    "A kernel is a way of computing the dot product of two vectors x and 􏱍y in some (possibly very high dimensional) feature space, which is why kernel functions are sometimes called “generalized dot product”\n",
    "The kernel trick is a method of using a linear classifier to solve a non-linear problem by transforming linearly inseparable data to linearly separable ones in a higher dimension.\n",
    "Q66 State the differences between causality and correlation?\n",

    "Q67 What is the exploding gradient problem while using the backpropagation\n",
    "technique?\n",
    "When large error gradients accumulate and result in large changes in the neural network weights during training, it is called the exploding gradient problem. The values of weights can become so large as to overflow and result in NaN values. This makes the model unstable and the learning of the model to stall just like the vanishing gradient problem.\n",

    " Q71 What is the difference between regularization and normalisation?\n",
    "Normalisation adjusts the data; regularisation adjusts the prediction function. If your data is on very different scales (especially low to high), you would want to normalise the data. Alter each column to have compatible basic statistics. This can be helpful to make sure there is no loss of accuracy. One of the goals of model training is to identify the signal and ignore the noise if the model is given free rein to minimize error, there is a possibility of suffering from overfitting. Regularization imposes some control on this by providing simpler fitting functions over complex ones.\n",
    "Q72 When does the linear regression line stop rotating or finds an optimal spot where it is fitted on data?\n",

    "Q73 How does the SVM algorithm deal with self-learning?\n",
    "SVM has a learning rate and expansion rate which takes care of this. The learning rate compensates or penalises the hyperplanes for making all the wrong moves and expansion rate deals with finding the maximum separation area between classes.\n",
    "Q74 How do you handle outliers in the data?\n",
    "Outlier is an observation in the data set that is far away from other observations in the data set. We can discover outliers using tools and functions like box plot, scatter plot, Z-Score, IQR score etc. and then handle them based on the visualization we have got. To handle outliers, we can cap at some threshold, use transformations to reduce skewness of the data and remove outliers if they are anomalies or errors.\n",

    "In the context of data science or AIML, pruning refers to the process of reducing redundant branches of a decision tree. Decision Trees are prone to overfitting, pruning the tree helps to reduce the size and minimizes the chances of overfitting. Pruning involves turning branches of a decision tree into leaf nodes and removing the leaf nodes from the original branch. It serves as a tool to perform the tradeoff.\n",

    "A very important question for your machine learning interview. Backpropagation is the algorithm for computing artificial neural networks (ANN). It is used by the gradient descent optimization that exploits the chain rule. By calculating the gradient of the loss function, the weight of the neurons is adjusted to a certain value. To train a multi-layered neural network is the prime motivation of backpropagation so that it can learn the appropriate internal demonstrations. This will help them learn to map any input to its respective output arbitrarily.\n",
    "Q86 What is the Convex Function?\n",

    "Q87 What’s the Relationship between True Positive Rate and Recall?\n",
    "The True positive rate in machine learning is the percentage of the positives that have been properly acknowledged, and recall is just the count of the results that have been correctly identified and are relevant. Therefore, they are the same things, just having different names. It is also known as sensitivity.\n",

    "Q45. What is Pragmatic Ambiguity in NLP?\n",
    "Pragmatic ambiguity refers to those words which have more than one meaning and their use in any sentence can depend entirely on the context. Pragmatic ambiguity can result in multiple interpretations of the same sentence. More often than not, we come across sentences which have words with multiple meanings, making the sentence open to interpretation. This multiple interpretation causes ambiguity and is known as Pragmatic ambiguity in NLP.\n",
    "Q46. What is a Masked Language Model?\n",
    "Masked language models help learners to understand deep representations in downstream tasks by taking an output from the corrupt input. This model is often used to predict the words to be used in a sentence.\n",

    "Q49. What is POS tagging?\n",
    "Parts of speech tagging better known as POS tagging refers to the process of identifying specific words in a document and group them as part of speech, based on its context. POS tagging is also known as grammatical tagging since it involves understanding grammatical structures and identifying the respective component.\n",
    "POS tagging is a complicated process since the same word can be different parts of speech depending on the context. The same generic process used for word mapping is quite ineffective for POS tagging because of the same reason.\n",
    "Q50. What is NES?\n",
    "Name entity recognition is more commonly known as NER is the process of identifying specific entities in a text document which are more informative and have a unique context. These often denote places, people, organisations, and more. Even though it seems like these entities are\n",
    "Steve Nouri https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenouri/\n",
    " \n",
    "proper nouns, the NER process is far from identifying just the nouns. In fact, NER involves entity chunking or extraction wherein entities are segmented to categorise them under different predefined classes. This step further helps in extracting information.\n",
    "Q51 Explain the Masked Language Model?\n",
    "Masked language modelling is the process in which the output is taken from the corrupted input. This model helps the learners to master the deep representations in downstream tasks. You can predict a word from the other words of the sentence using this model.\n",
    "Q52 What is pragmatic analysis in NLP?\n",
    "Pragmatic Analysis: It deals with outside word knowledge, which means knowledge that is external to the documents and/or queries. Pragmatics analysis that focuses on what was described is reinterpreted by what it actually meant, deriving the various aspects of language that require real-world knowledge.\n",
    "Q53 What is perplexity in NLP?\n",
    "The word \"perplexed\" means \"puzzled\" or \"confused\", thus Perplexity in general means the inability to tackle something complicated and a problem that is not specified. Therefore, Perplexity in NLP is a way to determine the extent of uncertainty in predicting some text.\n",
    "In NLP, perplexity is a way of evaluating language models. Perplexity can be high and low; Low perplexity is ethical because the inability to deal with any complicated problem is less while high perplexity is terrible because the failure to deal with a complicated is high.\n",
    "Q54 What is ngram in NLP?\n",
    "N-gram in NLP is simply a sequence of n words, and we also conclude the sentences which appeared more frequently, for example, let us consider the progression of these three words:\n",
    "● New York (2 gram)\n",
    "● The Golden Compass (3 gram)\n",
    "● She was there in the hotel (4 gram)\n",
    "Now from the above sequence, we can easily conclude that sentence (a) appeared more frequently than the other two sentences, and the last sentence(c) is not seen that often. Now if we assign probability in the occurrence of an n-gram, then it will be advantageous. It would help in making next-word predictions and in spelling error corrections.\n",

    "Steve Nouri https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenouri/\n",
    " \n",
    " Q56 Why self-attention is awesome?\n",
    "“In terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence length n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece and byte-pair representations.” — from Attention is all you need\n",
    "Q57 What are stop words?\n",
    "Stop words are said to be useless data for a search engine. Words such as articles, prepositions, etc. are considered as stop words. There are stop words such as was, were, is, am, the, a, an, how, why, and many more. In Natural Language Processing, we eliminate the stop words to understand and analyze the meaning of a sentence. The removal of stop words is one of the most important tasks for search engines. Engineers design the algorithms of search engines in such a way that they ignore the use of stop words. This helps show the relevant search result for a query.\n",
    "Q58 What is Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI)?\n",
    "Steve Nouri https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenouri/\n",
    " \n",
    "Latent semantic indexing is a mathematical technique used to improve the accuracy of the information retrieval process. The design of LSI algorithms allows machines to detect the hidden (latent) correlation between semantics (words). To enhance information understanding, machines generate various concepts that associate with the words of a sentence.\n",
    "The technique used for information understanding is called singular value decomposition. It is generally used to handle static and unstructured data. The matrix obtained for singular value decomposition contains rows for words and columns for documents. This method best suits to identify components and group them according to their types.\n",
    "The main principle behind LSI is that words carry a similar meaning when used in a similar context. Computational LSI models are slow in comparison to other models. However, they are good at contextual awareness that helps improve the analysis and understanding of a text or a document.\n",
    "Q60 What are Regular Expressions?\n",
    "A regular expression is used to match and tag words. It consists of a series of characters for matching strings.\n",
    "Suppose, if A and B are regular expressions, then the following are true for them:\n",
    "● If {ɛ} is a regular language, then ɛ is a regular expression for it.\n",
    "● If A and B are regular expressions, then A + B is also a regular expression within the\n",
    "language {A, B}.\n",
    "● If A and B are regular expressions, then the concatenation of A and B (A.B) is a regular\n",
    "expression.\n",
    "● If A is a regular expression, then A* (A occurring multiple times) is also a regular\n",
    "expression.\n",
    "Q61 What are unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, and n-grams in NLP?\n",
    "When we parse a sentence one word at a time, then it is called a unigram. The sentence parsed two words at a time is a bigram.\n",
    "When the sentence is parsed three words at a time, then it is a trigram. Similarly, n-gram refers to the parsing of n words at a time.\n",
    "Example: To understand unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams, you can refer to the below diagram:\n",
    "Q62 What are the steps involved in solving an NLP problem?\n",
    "Below are the steps involved in solving an NLP problem:\n",

    "Q63. There have some various common elements of natural language processing. Those elements are very important for understanding NLP properly, can you please explain the same in details with an example?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "There have a lot of components normally using by natural language processing (NLP). Some of the major components are explained below:\n",
    "● Extraction of Entity: It actually identifying and extracting some critical data from the available information which help to segmentation of provided sentence on identifying each entity. It can help in identifying one human that it’s fictional or real, same kind of reality identification for any organization, events or any geographic location etc.\n",
    "● The analysis in a syntactic way: it mainly helps for maintaining ordering properly of the available words.\n",

    "● Reading of Machine Language: Extraction of the possible entity, linking with an individual entity, DBpedia, some libraries like Pikes or FRED.\n",
    "Q65 Explain briefly about word2vec\n",
    "Word2Vec embeds words in a lower-dimensional vector space using a shallow neural network. The result is a set of word-vectors where vectors close together in vector space have similar meanings based on context, and word-vectors distant to each other have differing meanings. For example, apple and orange would be close together and apple and gravity would be relatively far.\n",

    " \n",
    "There are two versions of this model based on skip-grams (SG) and continuous-bag-of-words (CBOW).\n",
    "Q66 What are the metrics used to test an NLP model?\n",
    "Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1. Accuracy is the usual ratio of the prediction to the desired output. But going just be accuracy is naive considering the complexities involved.\n",
    "Q67 What are some ways we can preprocess text input?\n",
    "Here are several preprocessing steps that are commonly used for NLP tasks:\n",
    "● case normalization: we can convert all input to the same case (lowercase or uppercase)\n",
    "as a way of reducing our text to a more canonical form\n",
    "● punctuation/stop word/white space/special characters removal: if we don’t think these\n",
    "words or characters are relevant, we can remove them to reduce the feature space\n",
    "● lemmatizing/stemming: we can also reduce words to their inflectional forms (i.e. walks →\n",
    "walk) to further trim our vocabulary\n",
    "● generalizing irrelevant information: we can replace all numbers with a <NUMBER> token\n",
    "or all names with a <NAME> token\n",
    "Q68 How does the encoder-decoder structure work for language modelling?\n",
    "The encoder-decoder structure is a deep learning model architecture responsible for several state of the art solutions, including Machine Translation.\n",
    "The input sequence is passed to the encoder where it is transformed to a fixed-dimensional vector representation using a neural network. The transformed input is then decoded using another neural network. Then, these outputs undergo another transformation and a softmax layer. The final output is a vector of probabilities over the vocabularies. Meaningful information is extracted based on these probabilities.\n",
    "Q69 What are attention mechanisms and why do we use them?\n",
    "This was a followup to the encoder-decoder question. Only the output from the last time step is passed to the decoder, resulting in a loss of information learned at previous time steps. This information loss is compounded for longer text sequences with more time steps.\n",
    "Attention mechanisms are a function of the hidden weights at each time step. When we use attention in encoder-decoder networks, the fixed-dimensional vector passed to the decoder becomes a function of all vectors outputted in the intermediary steps.\n",
    "Two commonly used attention mechanisms are additive attention and multiplicative attention. As the names suggest, additive attention is a weighted sum while multiplicative attention is a weighted multiplier of the hidden weights. During the training process, the model also learns weights for the attention mechanisms to recognize the relative importance of each time step.\n",
    "Q70 How would you implement an NLP system as a service, and what are some pitfalls you might face in production?\n",
    "This is less of a NLP question than a question for productionizing machine learning models. There are however certain intricacies to NLP models.\n",
    "Steve Nouri https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenouri/\n",
    " \n",
    "Without diving too much into the productionization aspect, an ideal Machine Learning service will have:\n",
    "● endpoint(s) that other business systems can use to make inference\n",
    "● a feedback mechanism for validating model predictions\n",
    "● a database to store predictions and ground truths from the feedback\n",

    "● some form of model version control to facilitate rollbacks in case of bad deployments\n",
    "● post-production accuracy and error monitoring\n",
    "Q71 How can we handle misspellings for text input?\n",
    "By using word embeddings trained over a large corpus (for instance, an extensive web scrape of billions of words), the model vocabulary would include common misspellings by design. The model can then learn the relationship between misspelled and correctly spelled words to recognize their semantic similarity.\n",
    "We can also preprocess the input to prevent misspellings. Terms not found in the model\n",
    "vocabulary can be mapped to the “closest” vocabulary term using:\n",
    "● edit distance between strings\n",
    "● phonetic distance between word pronunciations\n",

    "A) Naive Bayes\n",
    "B) SVM\n",
    "C) None of the above\n",
    "Solution: (C)\n",
    "Since, you are given only the data of tweets and no other information, which means there is no target variable present. One cannot train a supervised learning model, both svm and naive bayes are supervised learning techniques.\n",
    "Q73 You have created a document term matrix of the data, treating every tweet as one document. Which of the following is correct, in regards to document term matrix?\n",
    "1. Removal of stopwords from the data will affect the dimensionality of data\n",

    "E) 2 and 3\n",
    "F) 1, 2 and 3\n",
    "Solution: (D)\n",
    "Choices A and B are correct because stopword removal will decrease the number of features in the matrix, normalization of words will also reduce redundant features, and, converting all words to lowercase will also decrease the dimensionality.\n",

    "C) 50\n",
    "D) 75\n",
    "E) 100\n",
    "Solution: (A)\n",
    "LDA is unsupervised learning model, LDA is latent Dirichlet allocation, not Linear discriminant analysis. Selection of the number of topics is directly proportional to the size of the data, while number of topic terms is not directly proportional to the size of the data. Hence none of the statements are correct.\n",

    "SVD uses linear combination of inputs while a neural network uses nonlinear combination.\n",
    "Q79 What is the information in the hidden and cell state of LSTM?\n",

    "4( h+h2+h) where is input vectors size and h is output vectors size a.k.a. hidden\n",
    "The point to see here is that mh dictates the model size as m>>h. Hence it's important to have a small vocab.\n",

    "Time complexity of transfomer\n",
    "seq_length2*hidden\n",

    "Q81 What is the benefit of learning rate warm-up?\n",
    "Steve Nouri https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenouri/\n",
    " \n",
    "Learning rate warm-up is a learning rate schedule where you have low (or lower) learning rate at the beginning of training to avoid divergence due to unreliable gradients at the beginning. As the model becomes more stable, the learning rate would increase to speed up convergence.\n",
    "Q82 What’s the difference between hard and soft parameter sharing in multi-task learning?\n",
    "Hard sharing is where we train for all the task at the same time and update our weights using all the losses whereas soft sharing is where we train for one task at a time.\n",
    "Q83 What’s the difference between BatchNorm and LayerNorm?\n",
    "BatchNorm computes the mean and variance at each layer for every minibatch whereas LayerNorm computes the mean and variance for every sample for each layer independently. Batch normalisation allows you to set higher learning rates, increasing speed of training as it reduces the unstability of initial starting weights.\n",
    "Q84 Difference between BatchNorm and LayerNorm?\n",
    "BatchNorm — Compute the mean and var at each layer for every minibatch\n",
    "LayerNorm — Compute the mean and var for every single sample for each layer independently\n",
    "Q85 Why does the transformer block have LayerNorm instead of BatchNorm?\n",

    "Q86 What changes would you make to your deep learning code if you knew there are errors in your training data?\n",
    "We can do label smoothening where the smoothening value is based on % error. If any particular class has known error, we can also use class weights to modify the loss.\n",

    "Q97 How would you make a sentiment classifier?\n",
    "This is a trick question. The interviewee can say all things such as using transfer learning and latest models but they need to talk about having a neutral class too otherwise you can have really good accuracy/f1 and still, the model will classify everything into positive or negative.\n",
    "The truth is that a lot of news is neutral and so the training needs to have this class. The interviewee should also talk about how he will create a dataset and his training strategies like the selection of language model, language model fine-tuning and using various datasets for multi- task learning.\n",
    "Q98 What is the difference between regular expression and regular grammar?\n",
    "A regular expression is the representation of natural language in the form of mathematical expressions containing a character sequence. On the other hand, regular grammar is the generator of natural language, defining a set of defined rules and syntax which the strings in the natural language must follow.\n",
    "Q99 Why should we use Batch Normalization?\n",
    "Once the interviewer has asked you about the fundamentals of deep learning architectures, they\n",
    "would move on to the key topic of improving your deep learning model’s performance.\n",
    "Batch Normalization is one of the techniques used for reducing the training time of our deep learning algorithm. Just like normalizing our input helps improve our logistic regression model, we can normalize the activations of the hidden layers in our deep learning model as well:\n",
    "Q100 How is backpropagation different in RNN compared to ANN?\n",
    "In Recurrent Neural Networks, we have an additional loop at each node:\n",
    "This loop essentially includes a time component into the network as well. This helps in capturing sequential information from the data, which could not be possible in a generic artificial neural network.\n",

    "Top 100 Questions on Computer Vision\n",
    "By Steve Nouri\n",
    "Q1 Which of the following is a challenge when dealing with computer vision problems?\n",
    "Variations due to geometric changes (like pose, scale, etc), Variations due to photometric factors (like illumination, appearance, etc) and Image occlusion. All the above-mentioned options are challenges in computer vision\n",
    "Q2 Consider an image with width and height as 100×100. Each pixel in the image can have a color from Grayscale, i.e. values. How much space would this image require for storing?\n",
    "The answer will be 8x100x100 because 8 bits will be required to represent a number from 0-256\n",
    "Q3 Why do we use convolutions for images rather than just FC layers?\n",
    "Firstly, convolutions preserve, encode, and actually use the spatial information from the image. If we used only FC layers we would have no relative spatial information. Secondly, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have a partially built-in translation in-variance, since each convolution kernel acts as it's own filter/feature detector.\n",
    "Q4 What makes CNN’s translation-invariant?\n",
    "As explained above, each convolution kernel acts as it's own filter/feature detector. So let's say you're doing object detection, it doesn't matter where in the image the object is since we're going to apply the convolution in a sliding window fashion across the entire image anyways.\n",
    "Q5 Why do we have max-pooling in classification CNNs?\n",
    "for a role in Computer Vision. Max-pooling in a CNN allows you to reduce computation since your feature maps are smaller after the pooling. You don't lose too much semantic information since you're taking the maximum activation. There's also a theory that max-pooling contributes a bit to giving CNN’s more translation in-variance. Check out this great video from Andrew Ng on the benefits of max-pooling.\n",
    "Q6 Why do segmentation CNN’s typically have an encoder-decoder style/structure?\n",
    "The encoder CNN can basically be thought of as a feature extraction network, while the decoder uses that information to predict the image segments by \"decoding\" the features and upscaling to the original image size.\n",
    "  Steve Nouri\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7 What is the significance of Residual Networks?\n",
    "The main thing that residual connections did was allow for direct feature access from previous layers. This makes information propagation throughout the network much easier. One very interesting paper about this shows how using local skip connections gives the network a type of ensemble multi-path structure, giving features multiple paths to propagate throughout the network.\n",
    "Q8 What is batch normalization and why does it work?\n",
    "Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. The idea is then to normalize the inputs of each layer in such a way that they have a mean output activation of zero and a standard deviation of one. This is done for each individual mini-batch at each layer i.e compute the mean and variance of that mini-batch alone, then normalize. This is analogous to how the inputs to networks are standardized. How does this help? We know that normalizing the inputs to a network helps it learn. But a network is just a series of layers, where the output of one layer becomes the input to the next. That means we can think of any layer in a neural network as the first layer of a smaller subsequent network. Thought of as a series of neural networks feeding into each other, we normalize the output of one layer before applying the activation function and then feed it into the following layer (sub-network).\n",
    "Q9 Why would you use many small convolutional kernels such as 3x3 rather than a few large ones?\n",
    "This is very well explained in the VGGNet paper. There are 2 reasons: First, you can use several smaller kernels rather than few large ones to get the same receptive field and capture more spatial context, but with the smaller kernels you are using less parameters and computations. Secondly, because with smaller kernels you will be using more filters, you'll be able to use more activation functions and thus have a more discriminative mapping function being learned by your CNN.\n",
    "Q10 What is Precision?\n",
    "Precision (also called positive predictive value) is the fraction of relevant instances among the retrieved instances\n",
    "Precision = true positive / (true positive + false positive)\n",
    "Q11 What is Recall?\n",
    "Recall (also known as sensitivity) is the fraction of relevant instances that have been retrieved over the total amount of relevant instances. Recall = true positive / (true positive + false negative)\n",
    "Q12 Define F1-score.\n",
    "It is the weighted average of precision and recall. It considers both false positive and false\n",
    "negatives into account. It is used to measure the model’s performance.\n",
    " Steve Nouri\n",
    "\n",
    "F1-Score = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)\n",
    "Q13 What is cost function?\n",
    "The cost function is a scalar function that Quantifies the error factor of the Neural Network. Lower the cost function better than the Neural network. Eg: MNIST Data set to classify the image, the input image is digit 2 and the Neural network wrongly predicts it to be 3\n",
    "Q14 List different activation neurons or functions\n",

    "● Binary Threshold Neuron\n",
    "● Stochastic Binary Neuron\n",

    "● Tanh function\n",
    "● Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)\n",
    "Q15 Define Learning rate.\n",
    "The learning rate is a hyper-parameter that controls how much we are adjusting the weights of our network with respect to the loss gradient.\n",
    "Q16 What is Momentum (w.r.t NN optimization)?\n",
    "Momentum lets the optimization algorithm remembers its last step, and adds some proportion of it to the current step. This way, even if the algorithm is stuck in a flat region, or a small local minimum, it can get out and continue towards the true minimum.\n",
    "Q17 What is the difference between Batch Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent?\n",
    "Batch gradient descent computes the gradient using the whole dataset. This is great for convex or relatively smooth error manifolds. In this case, we move somewhat directly towards an optimum solution, either local or global. Additionally, batch gradient descent, given an annealed learning rate, will eventually find the minimum located in its basin of attraction.\n",
    "Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) computes the gradient using a single sample. SGD works well (Not well, I suppose, but better than batch gradient descent) for error manifolds that have lots of local maxima/minima. In this case, the somewhat noisier gradient calculated using the reduced number of samples tends to jerk the model out of local minima into a region that hopefully is more optimal.\n",
    "Q18 Epoch vs Batch vs Iteration.\n",
    "Epoch: one forward pass and one backward pass of all the training examples Batch: examples processed together in one pass (forward and backward) Iteration: number of training examples / Batch size\n",
    "Steve Nouri\n",
    "\n",
    "Q19 What is the vanishing gradient?\n",
    "As we add more and more hidden layers, backpropagation becomes less and less useful in passing information to the lower layers. In effect, as information is passed back, the gradients begin to vanish and become small relative to the weights of the networks.\n",
    "Q20 What are dropouts?\n",
    "Dropout is a simple way to prevent a neural network from overfitting. It is the dropping out of some of the units in a neural network. It is similar to the natural reproduction process, where nature produces offsprings by combining distinct genes (dropping out others) rather than strengthening the co-adapting of them.\n",
    "Q21 Can you explain the differences between supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning?\n",
    "In supervised learning, we train a model to learn the relationship between input data and output data. We need to have labeled data to be able to do supervised learning.\n",
    "With unsupervised learning, we only have unlabeled data. The model learns a representation of the data. Unsupervised learning is frequently used to initialize the parameters of the model when we have a lot of unlabeled data and a small fraction of labeled data. We first train an unsupervised model and, after that, we use the weights of the model to train a supervised model. In reinforcement learning, the model has some input data and a reward depending on the output of the model. The model learns a policy that maximizes the reward. Reinforcement learning has been applied successfully to strategic games such as Go and even classic Atari video games.\n",
    "Q22 What is data augmentation? Can you give some examples?\n",
    "Data augmentation is a technique for synthesizing new data by modifying existing data in such a way that the target is not changed, or it is changed in a known way. Computer vision is one of the fields where data augmentation is very useful. There are many modifications that we can do to images:\n",
    "● Resize\n",
    "● Horizontal or vertical flip\n",
    "● Rotate, Add noise, Deform\n",
    "● Modify colors Each problem needs a customized data augmentation pipeline. For\n",
    "example, on OCR, doing flips will change the text and won’t be beneficial; however, resizes and small rotations may help.\n",
    "Q23 What are the components of GAN?\n",
    "● Generator\n",
    "● Discriminator\n",
    "Q24 What’s the difference between a generative and discriminative model?\n",
    "A generative model will learn categories of data while a discriminative model will simply learn the distinction between different categories of data. Discriminative models will generally outperform generative models on classification tasks.\n",
    "Steve Nouri\n",
    "\n",
    "Q25 What is Linear Filtering?\n",
    "Linear filtering is a neighborhood operation, which means that the output of a pixel’s value is decided by the weighted sum of the values of the input pixels.\n",
    "Q26 How can you achieve Blurring through Gaussian Filter?\n",
    "This is the most common technique for blurring or smoothing an image. This filter improves the resulting pixel found at the center and slowly minimizes the effects as pixels move away from the center. This filter can also help in removing noise in an image\n",
    "Q27 What is Non-Linear Filtering? How it is used?\n",
    "Linear filtering is easy to use and implement. In some cases, this method is enough to get the necessary output. However, an increase in performance can be obtained through non-linear filtering. Through non-linear filtering, we can have more control and achieve better results when we encounter a more complex computer vision task.\n",
    "Q28 Explain Median Filtering.\n",
    "The median filter is an example of a non-linear filtering technique. This technique is commonly used for minimizing the noise in an image. It operates by inspecting the image pixel by pixel and taking the place of each pixel’s value with the value of the neighboring pixel median.\n",
    "Some techniques in detecting and matching features are:\n",
    "● Lucas-Kanade\n",
    "● Harris\n",
    "● Shi-Tomasi\n",
    "● SUSAN (smallest uni value segment assimilating nucleus)\n",
    "● MSER (maximally stable extremal regions)\n",
    "● SIFT (scale-invariant feature transform)\n",
    "● HOG (histogram of oriented gradients)\n",
    "● FAST (features from accelerated segment test)\n",
    "● SURF (speeded-up robust features)\n",
    "Q29 Describe the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm\n",
    "SIFT solves the problem of detecting the corners of an object even if it is scaled. Steps to implement this algorithm:\n",
    "● Scale-space extrema detection – This step will identify the locations and scales that can still be recognized from different angles or views of the same object in an image.\n",
    "● Keypoint localization – When possible key points are located, they would be refined to get accurate results. This would result in the elimination of points that are low in contrast or points that have edges that are deficiently localized.\n",
    "● Orientation assignment – In this step, a consistent orientation is assigned to each key point to attain invariance when the image is being rotated.\n",
    "● Keypoint matching – In this step, the key points between images are now linked to recognizing their nearest neighbors.\n",
    "    Steve Nouri\n",
    "\n",
    "Q30 Why Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF) came into existence?\n",
    "SURF was introduced to as a speed-up version of SIFT. Though SIFT can detect and describe key points of an object in an image, still this algorithm is slow.\n",
    "Q31 What is Oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF (ORB)?\n",
    "This algorithm is a great possible substitute for SIFT and SURF, mainly because it performs better in computation and matching. It is a combination of fast keypoint detector and brief descriptor, which contains a lot of alterations to improve performance. It is also a great alternative in terms of cost because the SIFT and SURF algorithms are patented, which means that you need to buy them for their utilization.\n",
    "Q32 What is image segmentation?\n",
    "In computer vision, segmentation is the process of extracting pixels in an image that is related. Segmentation algorithms usually take an image and produce a group of contours (the boundary of an object that has well-defined edges in an image) or a mask where a set of related pixels are assigned to a unique color value to identify it.\n",
    "Popular image segmentation techniques:\n",
    "● Active contours\n",
    "● Level sets\n",
    "● Graph-based merging\n",
    "● Mean Shift\n",
    "● Texture and intervening contour-based normalized cuts\n",
    "Q33 What is the purpose of semantic segmentation?\n",
    "The purpose of semantic segmentation is to categorize every pixel of an image to a certain class or label. In semantic segmentation, we can see what is the class of a pixel by simply looking directly at the color, but one downside of this is that we cannot identify if two colored masks belong to a certain object.\n",
    "Q34 Explain instance segmentation.\n",
    "In semantic segmentation, the only thing that matters to us is the class of each pixel. This would somehow lead to a problem that we cannot identify if that class belongs to the same object or not. Semantic segmentation cannot identify if two objects in an image are separate entities. So to solve this problem, instance segmentation was created. This segmentation can identify two different objects of the same class. For example, if an image has two sheep in it, the sheep will be detected and masked with different colors to differentiate what instance of a class they belong to.\n",
    "Q35 How is panoptic segmentation different from semantic/instance segmentation?\n",
    "Panoptic segmentation is basically a union of semantic and instance segmentation. In panoptic segmentation, every pixel is classified by a certain class and those pixels that have several instances of a class are also determined. For example, if an image has two cars, these cars will\n",
    "    Steve Nouri\n",
    "\n",
    "be masked with different colors. These colors represent the same class — car — but point to different instances of a certain class.\n",
    "Q36 Explain the problem of recognition in computer vision.\n",
    "Recognition is one of the toughest challenges in the concepts in computer vision. Why is\n",
    "recognition hard? For the human eyes, recognizing an object’s features or attributes would be\n",
    "very easy. Humans can recognize multiple objects with very small effort. However, this does not apply to a machine. It would be very hard for a machine to recognize or detect an object because these objects vary. They vary in terms of viewpoints, sizes, or scales. Though these things are still challenges faced by most computer vision systems, they are still making advancements or approaches for solving these daunting tasks.\n",
    "Q37 What is Object Recognition?\n",
    "Object recognition is used for indicating an object in an image or video. This is a product of machine learning and deep learning algorithms. Object recognition tries to acquire this innate human ability, which is to understand certain features or visual detail of an image.\n",
    "Q38 What is Object Detection and it’s real-life use cases?\n",
    "Object detection in computer vision refers to the ability of machines to pinpoint the location of an object in an image or video. A lot of companies have been using object detection techniques in their system. They use it for face detection, web images, and security purposes.\n",
    "Q39 Describe Optical Flow, its uses, and assumptions.\n",
    "Optical flow is the pattern of apparent motion of image objects between two consecutive frames caused by the movement of object or camera. It is a 2D vector field where each vector is a displacement vector showing the movement of points from the first frame to the second\n",
    "Optical flow has many applications in areas like :\n",
    "● Structure from Motion\n",
    "● Video Compression\n",
    "● Video Stabilization ...\n",
    "Optical flow works on several assumptions:\n",
    "1. The pixel intensities of an object do not change between consecutive frames.\n",
    "2. Neighboring pixels have similar motion.\n",
    "Q40 What is Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)?\n",
    "HOG stands for Histograms of Oriented Gradients. HOG is a type of “feature descriptor”. The\n",
    "intent of a feature descriptor is to generalize the object in such a way that the same object (in this case a person) produces as close as possible to the same feature descriptor when viewed under different conditions. This makes the classification task easier.\n",
    " Steve Nouri\n",
    "\n",
    "Q41 What is BOV: Bag-of-visual-words (BOV)?\n",
    "BOV also called the bag of keypoints, is based on vector quantization. Similar to HOG features, BOV features are histograms that count the number of occurrences of certain patterns within a patch of the image.\n",
    "Q42 What is Poselets? Where are poselets used?\n",
    "Poselets rely on manually added extra keypoints such as “right shoulder”, “left shoulder”, “right knee” and “left knee”. They were originally used for human pose estimation\n",
    "Q43 Explain Textons in context of CNNs\n",
    "A texton is the minimal building block of vision. The computer vision literature does not give a strict definition for textons, but edge detectors could be one example. One might argue that deep learning techniques with Convolution Neuronal Networks (CNNs) learn textons in the first filters.\n",
    "Q44 What is Markov Random Fields (MRFs)?\n",
    "MRFs are undirected probabilistic graphical models which are a wide-spread model in computer vision. The overall idea of MRFs is to assign a random variable for each feature and a random variable for each pixel\n",
    "Q45 Explain the concept of superpixel?\n",
    "A superpixel is an image patch that is better aligned with intensity edges than a rectangular patch. Superpixels can be extracted with any segmentation algorithm, however, most of them produce highly irregular superpixels, with widely varying sizes and shapes. A more regular space tessellation may be desired.\n",
    "Q46 What is Non-maximum suppression(NMS) and where is it used?\n",
    "NMS is often used along with edge detection algorithms. The image is scanned along the image gradient direction, and if pixels are not part of the local maxima they are set to zero. It is widely used in object detection algorithms.\n",
    "Q47 Describe the use of Computer Vision in Healthcare.\n",
    "Computer vision has also been an important part of advances in health-tech. Computer vision algorithms can help automate tasks such as detecting cancerous moles in skin images or finding symptoms in x-ray and MRI scans.\n",
    "Q48 Describe the use of Computer Vision in Augmented Reality & Mixed Reality\n",
    "Computer vision also plays an important role in augmented and mixed reality, the technology that enables computing devices such as smartphones, tablets, and smart glasses to overlay and embed virtual objects on real-world imagery. Using computer vision, AR gear detects objects in the real world in order to determine the locations on a device’s display to place a virtual object. For instance, computer vision algorithms can help AR applications detect planes such as\n",
    "Steve Nouri\n",
    "\n",
    "tabletops, walls, and floors, a very important part of establishing depth and dimensions and placing virtual objects in the physical world.\n",
    "Q49 Describe the use of Computer Vision in Facial Recognition\n",
    "Computer vision also plays an important role in facial recognition applications, the technology that enables computers to match images of people’s faces to their identities. Computer vision algorithms detect facial features in images and compare them with databases of face profiles. Consumer devices use facial recognition to authenticate the identities of their owners. Social media apps use facial recognition to detect and tag users. Law enforcement agencies also rely on facial recognition technology to identify criminals in video feeds.\n",
    "Q50 Describe the use of Computer Vision in Self-Driving Cars\n",
    "Computer vision enables self-driving cars to make sense of their surroundings. Cameras capture video from different angles around the car and feed it to computer vision software, which then processes the images in real-time to find the extremities of roads, read traffic signs, detect other cars, objects, and pedestrians. The self-driving car can then steer its way on streets and highways, avoid hitting obstacles, and (hopefully) safely drive its passengers to their destination.\n",
    "Q51 Explain famous Computer Vision tasks using a single image example.\n",
    "Many popular computer vision applications involve trying to recognize things in photographs; for example:\n",
    "Object Object Object Object Object Object Object\n",
    "Classification: What broad category of object is in this photograph? Identification: Which type of a given object is in this photograph? Verification: Is the object in the photograph?\n",
    "Detection: Where are the objects in the photograph?\n",
    "Landmark Detection: What are the key points for the object in the photograph? Segmentation: What pixels belong to the object in the image?\n",
    "Recognition: What objects are in this photograph and where are they?\n",
    "Q52 Explain the distinction between Computer Vision and Image Processing.\n",
    "Computer vision is distinct from image processing.\n",
    "Image processing is the process of creating a new image from an existing image, typically simplifying or enhancing the content in some way. It is a type of digital signal processing and is not concerned with understanding the content of an image.\n",
    "A given computer vision system may require image processing to be applied to raw input, e.g. pre-processing images.\n",
    "Examples of image processing include:\n",
    "● Normalizing photometric properties of the image, such as brightness or color.\n",
    "● Cropping the bounds of the image, such as centering an object in a photograph.\n",
    "● Removing digital noise from an image, such as digital artifacts from low light levels.\n",

    "● Surveillance\n",
    "● Fingerprint recognition and biometrics\n",
    "Q54 What is the Boltzmann Machine?\n",
    "One of the most basic Deep Learning models is a Boltzmann Machine, resembling a simplified version of the Multi-Layer Perceptron. This model features a visible input layer and a hidden layer -- just a two-layer neural net that makes stochastic decisions as to whether a neuron should be on or off. Nodes are connected across layers, but no two nodes of the same layer are connected.\n",
    "Q56 What Is the Role of Activation Functions in a Neural Network?\n",
    "At the most basic level, an activation function decides whether a neuron should be fired or not. It accepts the weighted sum of the inputs and bias as input to any activation function. Step function, Sigmoid, ReLU, Tanh, and Softmax are examples of activation functions.\n",
    "Q57 What Is the Difference Between a Feedforward Neural Network and Recurrent Neural Network?\n",
    "A Feedforward Neural Network signals travel in one direction from input to output. There are no feedback loops; the network considers only the current input. It cannot memorize previous inputs (e.g., CNN).\n",
    "Q58 What Are the Applications of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)?\n",
    "The RNN can be used for sentiment analysis, text mining, and image captioning. Recurrent Neural Networks can also address time series problems such as predicting the prices of stocks in a month or quarter.\n",
    "Q59 What Are the Softmax and ReLU Functions?\n",
    "Softmax is an activation function that generates the output between zero and one. It divides each output, such that the total sum of the outputs is equal to one. Softmax is often used for output layers.\n",
    "Steve Nouri\n",
    "\n",
    "Q60 What Are Hyperparameters?\n",
    "With neural networks, you’re usually working with hyperparameters once the data is formatted\n",
    "correctly. A hyperparameter is a parameter whose value is set before the learning process begins. It determines how a network is trained and the structure of the network (such as the number of hidden units, the learning rate, epochs, etc.).\n",
    "Q61 What Will Happen If the Learning Rate Is Set Too Low or Too High?\n",
    "When your learning rate is too low, training of the model will progress very slowly as we are making minimal updates to the weights. It will take many updates before reaching the minimum point. If the learning rate is set too high, this causes undesirable divergent behavior to the loss function due to drastic updates in weights. It may fail to converge (model can give a good output) or even diverge (data is too chaotic for the network to train).\n",
    "Q62 How Are Weights Initialized in a Network?\n",
    "There are two methods here: we can either initialize the weights to zero or assign them randomly. Initializing all weights to 0: This makes your model similar to a linear model. All the neurons and every layer perform the same operation, giving the same output and making the deep net useless. Initializing all weights randomly: Here, the weights are assigned randomly by initializing them very close to 0. It gives better accuracy to the model since every neuron performs different computations. This is the most commonly used method.\n",
    "Q63 What Are the Different Layers on CNN?\n",
    "There are four layers in CNN:\n",
    "1. Convolutional Layer - the layer that performs a convolutional operation, creating several\n",
    "smaller picture windows to go over the data.\n",
    "2. ReLU Layer - it brings non-linearity to the network and converts all the negative pixels to\n",
    "zero. The output is a rectified feature map.\n",
    "3. Pooling Layer - pooling is a down-sampling operation that reduces the dimensionality of\n",
    "the feature map.\n",
    "4. Fully Connected Layer - this layer recognizes and classifies the objects in the image.\n",
    "Q64 What is Pooling on CNN, and How Does It Work?\n",
    "Pooling is used to reduce the spatial dimensions of a CNN. It performs down-sampling operations to reduce the dimensionality and creates a pooled feature map by sliding a filter matrix over the input matrix.\n",
    "Q65 How Does an LSTM Network Work?\n",
    "Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a special kind of recurrent neural network capable of learning long-term dependencies, remembering information for long periods as its default behavior. There are three steps in an LSTM network:\n",
    "Steve Nouri\n",
    "\n",
    "● Step 1: The network decides what to forget and what to remember.\n",
    "● Step 2: It selectively updates cell state values.\n",
    "● Step 3: The network decides what part of the current state makes it to the output.\n",
    "Q66 What Is the Difference Between Epoch, Batch, and Iteration in Deep Learning?\n",
    "● Epoch - Represents one iteration over the entire dataset (everything put into the training model).\n",
    "● Batch - Refers to when we cannot pass the entire dataset into the neural network at once, so we divide the dataset into several batches.\n",
    "● Iteration - if we have 10,000 images as data and a batch size of 200. then an epoch should run 50 iterations (10,000 divided by 50).\n",
    "Q67 Why Is Tensorflow the Most Preferred Library in Deep Learning?\n",
    "Tensorflow provides both C++ and Python APIs, making it easier to work on and has a faster compilation time compared to other Deep Learning libraries like Keras and Torch. Tensorflow supports both CPU and GPU computing devices.\n",
    "Q68 What Do You Mean by Tensor in Tensorflow?\n",
    "A tensor is a mathematical object represented as arrays of higher dimensions. These arrays of\n",
    "data with different dimensions and ranks fed as input to the neural network are called “Tensors.”\n",
    "Q69 Explain a Computational Graph.\n",
    "Everything in TensorFlow is based on creating a computational graph. It has a network of nodes where each node operates, Nodes represent mathematical operations, and edges represent tensors. Since data flows in the form of a graph, it is also called a “DataFlow Graph.”\n",
    "Q70 What Is an Auto-encoder?\n",
    "This Neural Network has three layers in which the input neurons are equal to the output neurons. The network's target outside is the same as the input. It uses dimensionality reduction to restructure the input. It works by compressing the image input to a latent space representation then reconstructing the output from this representation.\n",
    "Q71 Can we have the same bias for all neurons of a hidden layer?\n",
    "Essentially, you can have a different bias value at each layer or at each neuron as well. However, it is best if we have a bias matrix for all the neurons in the hidden layers as well.\n",
    "A point to note is that both these strategies would give you very different results.\n",
    "Q72 In a neural network, what if all the weights are initialized with the same value?\n",
    "In simplest terms, if all the neurons have the same value of weights, each hidden unit will get exactly the same signal. While this might work during forward propagation, the derivative of the cost function during backward propagation would be the same every time.\n",
    " Steve Nouri\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, there is no learning happening by the network! What do you call the phenomenon of the model being unable to learn any patterns from the data? Yes, underfitting.\n",
    "Therefore, if all weights have the same initial value, this would lead to underfitting.\n",
    "Q73 What is the role of weights and bias in a neural network?\n",
    "This is a question best explained with a real-life example. Consider that you want to go out today to play a cricket match with your friends. Now, a number of factors can affect your decision- making, like:\n",
    "● How many of your friends can make it to the game?\n",
    "● How much equipment can all of you bring?\n",
    "● What is the temperature outside?\n",
    "And so on. These factors can change your decision greatly or not too much. For example, if it is raining outside, then you cannot go out to play at all. Or if you have only one bat, you can share it while playing as well. The magnitude by which these factors can affect the game is called the weight of that factor.\n",
    "Factors like the weather or temperature might have a higher weight, and other factors like equipment would have a lower weight.\n",
    "Q74 Why does a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) work better with image data?\n",
    "The key to this question lies in the Convolution operation. Unlike humans, the machine sees the image as a matrix of pixel values. Instead of interpreting a shape like a petal or an ear, it just identifies curves and edges.\n",
    "Thus, instead of looking at the entire image, it helps to just read the image in parts. Doing this for a 300 x 300-pixel image would mean dividing the matrix into smaller 3 x 3 matrices and dealing with them one by one. This is convolution.\n",
    "Q75 Why do RNNs work better with text data?\n",
    "The main component that differentiates Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) from the other models is the addition of a loop at each node. This loop brings the recurrence mechanism in RNNs. In a basic Artificial Neural Network (ANN), each input is given the same weight and fed to the network at the same time. So, for a sentence like “I saw the movie and hated it”, it would be difficult to capture the information which associates “it” with the “movie”.\n",
    "Q76 In a CNN, if the input size 5 X 5 and the filter size is 7 X 7, then what would be the size of the output?\n",
    "This is a pretty intuitive answer. As we saw above, we perform the convolution on ‘x’ one step at a time, to the right, and in the end, we got Z with dimensions 2 X 2, for X with dimensions 3 X 3. Thus, to make the input size similar to the filter size, we make use of padding – adding 0s to the input matrix such that its new size becomes at least 7 X 7. Thus, the output size would be using the formula:\n",
    "Dimension of image = (n, n) = 5 X 5\n",
    "Dimension of filter = (f,f) = 7 X 7\n",
    "Padding = 1 (adding 1 pixel with value 0 all around the edges) Dimension of output will be (n+2p-f+1) X (n+2p-f+1) = 1 X 1\n",
    " Steve Nouri\n",
    "\n",
    "Q77 What’s the difference between valid and same padding in a CNN?\n",
    "This question has more chances of being a follow-up question to the previous one. Or if you have explained how you used CNNs in a computer vision task, the interviewer might ask this question along with the details of the padding parameters.\n",
    "● Valid Padding: When we do not use any padding. The resultant matrix after convolution will have dimensions (n – f + 1) X (n – f + 1)\n",
    "● Same padding: Adding padded elements all around the edges such that the output matrix will have the same dimensions as that of the input matrix\n",
    "Q78 What are the applications of transfer learning in Deep Learning?\n",
    "I am sure you would have a doubt as to why a relatively simple question was included in the Intermediate Level. The reason is the sheer volume of subsequent questions it can generate! The use of transfer learning has been one of the key milestones in deep learning. Training a large model on a huge dataset, and then using the final parameters on smaller simpler datasets has led to defining breakthroughs in the form of Pretrained Models. Be it Computer Vision or NLP, pretrained models have become the norm in research and in the industry. Some popular examples include BERT, ResNet, GPT-2, VGG-16, etc, and many more.\n",
    "Q79 Why is GRU faster as compared to LSTM?\n",
    "As you can see, the LSTM model can become quite complex. In order to still retain the functionality of retaining information across time and yet not make a too complex model, we need GRUs. Basically, in GRUs, instead of having an additional Forget gate, we combine the input and Forget gates into a single Update Gate:\n",
    "Q80 How is the transformer architecture better than RNN?\n",
    "Advancements in deep learning have made it possible to solve many tasks in Natural Language Processing. Networks/Sequence models like RNNs, LSTMs, etc. are specifically used for this purpose – so as to capture all possible information from a given sentence, or a paragraph. However, sequential processing comes with its caveats:\n",
    "● It requires high processing power\n",
    "● It is difficult to execute in parallel because of its sequential nature\n",
    "Q81 How Can We Scale GANs Beyond Image Synthesis?\n",
    "Aside from applications like image-to-image translation and domain-adaptation most GAN successes have been in image synthesis. Attempts to use GANs beyond images have focused on three domains: Text, Structured Data and Audio\n",
    "Q82 How Should we Evaluate GANs and When Should We Use Them?\n",
    "When it comes to evaluating GANs, there are many proposals but little consensus. Suggestions include:\n",
    " Steve Nouri\n",
    "\n",
    "● Inception Score and FID - Both these scores use a pre-trained image classifier and both have known issues. A common criticism is that these scores measure ‘sample quality’ and don’t really capture ‘sample diversity’.\n",
    "● MS-SSIM - propose using MS-SSIM to separately evaluate diversity, but this technique has some issues and hasn’t really caught on.\n",
    "● AIS - propose putting a Gaussian observation model on the outputs of a GAN and using annealed importance sampling to estimate the log-likelihood under this model, but show that estimates computed this way are inaccurate in the case where the GAN generator is also a flow model The generator being a flow model allows for the computation of exact log-likelihoods in this case.\n",
    "● Geometry Score - suggest computing geometric properties of the generated data manifold and comparing those properties to the real data.\n",
    "● Precision and Recall - attempt to measure both the ‘precision’ and ‘recall’ of GANs.\n",
    "● Skill Rating - have shown that trained GAN discriminators can contain useful information\n",
    "with which evaluation can be performed.\n",
    "Q83 What should we use GANs for?\n",
    "If you want an actual density model, GANs probably isn’t the best choice. There is now good experimental evidence that GANs learn a ‘low support’ representation of the target dataset, which means there may be substantial parts of the test set to which a GAN (implicitly) assigns zero likelihood.\n",
    "Q84 How should we evaluate GANs on these perceptual tasks?\n",
    "Ideally, we would just use a human judge, but this is expensive. A cheap proxy is to see if a classifier can distinguish between real and fake examples. This is called a classifier two-sample test (C2STs). The main issue with C2STs is that if the Generator has even a minor defect that’s systematic across samples (e.g., ) this will dominate the evaluation.\n",
    "Q85 Explain the problem of Vanishing Gradients in GANs\n",
    "Research has suggested that if your discriminator is too good, then generator training can fail due to vanishing gradients. In effect, an optimal discriminator doesn't provide enough information for the generator to make progress.\n",
    "Attempts to Remedy\n",
    "● Wasserstein loss: The Wasserstein loss is designed to prevent vanishing gradients even when you train the discriminator to optimality.\n",
    "● Modified minimax loss: The original GAN paper proposed a modification to minimax loss to deal with vanishing gradients.\n",
    "Q86 What is Mode Collapse and why it is a big issue?\n",
    "Usually, you want your GAN to produce a wide variety of outputs. You want, for example, a different face for every random input to your face generator.\n",
    "However, if a generator produces an especially plausible output, the generator may learn to produce only that output. In fact, the generator is always trying to find the one output that seems most plausible to the discriminator.\n",
    "    Steve Nouri\n",
    "\n",
    "If the generator starts producing the same output (or a small set of outputs) over and over again, the discriminator's best strategy is to learn to always reject that output. But if the next generation of discriminator gets stuck in a local minimum and doesn't find the best strategy, then it's too easy for the next generator iteration to find the most plausible output for the current discriminator. Each iteration of generator over-optimizes for a particular discriminator and the discriminator never manages to learn its way out of the trap. As a result, the generators rotate through a small set of output types. This form of GAN failure is called mode collapse.\n",
    "Q87 ExplainProgressive GANs\n",
    "In a progressive GAN, the generator's first layers produce very low resolution images, and subsequent layers add details. This technique allows the GAN to train more quickly than comparable non-progressive GANs, and produces higher resolution images.\n",
    "Q88 Explain Conditional GANs\n",
    "Conditional GANs train on a labeled data set and let you specify the label for each generated instance. For example, an unconditional MNIST GAN would produce random digits, while a conditional MNIST GAN would let you specify which digit the GAN should generate.\n",
    "Instead of modeling the joint probability P(X, Y), conditional GANs model the conditional probability P(X | Y).\n",
    "For more information about conditional GANs, see Mirza et al, 2014.\n",
    "Q89 Explain Image-to-Image Translation\n",
    "Image-to-Image translation GANs take an image as input and map it to a generated output image with different properties. For example, we can take a mask image with blob of color in the shape of a car, and the GAN can fill in the shape with photorealistic car details.\n",
    "Q90 Explain CycleGAN\n",
    "CycleGANs learn to transform images from one set into images that could plausibly belong to another set. For example, a CycleGAN produced the righthand image below when given the lefthand image as input. It took an image of a horse and turned it into an image of a zebra.\n",
    "Q91 What is Super-resolution?\n",
    "Super-resolution GANs increase the resolution of images, adding detail where necessary to fill in blurry areas. For example, the blurry middle image below is a downsampled version of the original image on the left. Given the blurry image, a GAN produced the sharper image on the right:\n",
    "Q92 Explain different problems in GANs\n",
    "Many GAN models suffer the following major problems:\n",
    "● Non-convergence: the model parameters oscillate, destabilize and never converge,\n",
    "● Mode collapse: the generator collapses which produces limited varieties of samples,\n",
    " Steve Nouri\n",
    "\n",
    "● Diminished gradient: the discriminator gets too successful that the generator gradient vanishes and learns nothing,\n",
    "● Unbalance between the generator and discriminator causing overfitting, &\n",
    "● Highly sensitive to the hyperparameter selections.\n",
    "Q93 Describe Cost v.s. image quality in GANS?\n",
    "In a discriminative model, the loss measures the accuracy of the prediction and we use it to monitor the progress of the training. However, the loss in GAN measures how well we are doing compared with our opponent. Often, the generator cost increases but the image quality is actually improving. We fall back to examine the generated images manually to verify the progress. This makes model comparison harder which leads to difficulties in picking the best model in a single run. It also complicates the tuning process.\n",
    "Q94 Why Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used in Computer Vision?\n",
    "The singular value decomposition is the most common and useful decomposition in computer vision. The goal of computer vision is to explain the three-dimensional world through two- dimensional pictures.\n",
    "Q95 What Is Image Transform?\n",
    "An image can be expanded in terms of a discrete set of basis arrays called basis images. Hence, these basis images can be generated by unitary matrices. An NxN image can be viewed as an N^2×1 vector. It provides a set of coordinates or basis vectors for vector space.\n",
    "Q96 List The Hardware Oriented Color Models?\n",
    "They are as follows. – RGB model\n",
    "– CMY model\n",
    "– YIQ model\n",
    "– HSI model\n",
    "Q96 What Is The Need For Transform?\n",
    "Answer: The need for transform is most of the signals or images are time-domain signal (ie) signals can be measured with a function of time. This representation is not always best. Any person of the mathematical transformations is applied to the signal or images to obtain further information from that signal. Particularly, for image processing.\n",
    "Q97 What is FPN?\n",
    "Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) is a feature extractor designed with a feature pyramid concept to improve accuracy and speed. Images are first to pass through the CNN pathway, yielding semantically rich final layers. Then to regain better resolution, it creates a top-down pathway by upsampling this feature map.\n",

       "'https://spin.atomicobject.com/2015/02/12/central-limit-theorem-intro/\\nSuppose that we are interested in estimating the average height among all people. Collecting data for every person in the world is impractical, bordering on impossible. While we can’t obtain a height measurement from everyone in the population, we can still sample some people. The question now becomes, what can we say about the average height of the entire population given a single sample.\\nThe Central Limit Theorem addresses this question exactly. Formally, it states that if we sample from a\\nEX:\\nAs we can see, the distribution is pretty ugly. It certainly isn’t normal, uniform, or any other commonly known distribution. In order to sample from the above distribution, we need to define a sample size, referred to as N. This is the number of observations that we will sample at a time. Suppose that we choose N to be 3. This means that we will sample in groups of 3. So for the above population, we might sample groups such as [5, 20, 41], [60, 17, 82], [8, 13, 61], and so on.\\nSuppose that we gather 1,000 samples of 3 from the above population. For each sample, we can compute its average. If we do that, we will have 1,000 averages. This set of 1,000 averages is called a sampling distribution, and according to Central Limit Theorem, the sampling distribution will approach a normal distribution as the sample size N used to produce it increases. Here is what our sample distribution looks like for N = 3.\\n   population using a sufficiently large sample size, the mean of the samples (also known as the sample population) will be normally distributed (assuming true random sampling), the mean tending to the mean of the population and variance equal to the variance of the population divided by the size of the sampling. What’s especially important is that this will be true regardless of the distribution of the original\\n population.\\n  \\n  As we can see, it certainly looks uni-modal, though not necessarily normal. If we repeat the same process with a larger sample size, we should see the sampling distribution start to become more normal. Let’s repeat the same process again with N = 10. Here is the sampling distribution for that sample size.'"

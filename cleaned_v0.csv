0,1 What is the Central Limit Theorem and why is it important?,"https://spinatomicobjectcom/2015/02/12/central-limit-theorem-intro/
Suppose that we are interested in estimating the average height among all people Collecting data for every person in the world is impractical, bordering on impossible While we cant obtain a height measurement from everyone in the population, we can still sample some people The question now becomes, what can we say about the average height of the entire population given a single sample
The Central Limit Theorem addresses this question exactly Formally, it states that if we sample from a
EX:
As we can see, the distribution is pretty ugly It certainly isnt normal, uniform, or any other commonly known distribution In order to sample from the above distribution, we need to define a sample size, referred to as N This is the number of observations that we will sample at a time Suppose that we choose N to be 3 This means that we will sample in groups of 3 So for the above population, we might sample groups such as [5, 20, 41], [60, 17, 82], [8, 13, 61], and so on
Suppose that we gather 1,000 samples of 3 from the above population For each sample, we can compute its average If we do that, we will have 1,000 averages This set of 1,000 averages is called a sampling distribution, and according to Central Limit Theorem, the sampling distribution will approach a normal distribution as the sample size N used to produce it increases Here is what our sample distribution looks like for N = 3
population using a sufficiently large sample size, the mean of the samples (also known as the sample population) will be normally distributed (assuming true random sampling), the mean tending to the mean of the population and variance equal to the variance of the population divided by the size of the sampling Whats especially important is that this will be true regardless of the distribution of the original
population
As we can see, it certainly looks uni-modal, though not necessarily normal If we repeat the same process with a larger sample size, we should see the sampling distribution start to become more normal Lets repeat the same process again with N = 10 Here is the sampling distribution for that sample size",[]
1,2 What is sampling? How many sampling methods do you know?,"https://searchbusinessanalyticstechtargetcom/definition/data-sampling https://nikolanewscom/difference-between-stratified-sampling-cluster-sampling-and-quota-sampling/
It enables data scientists, predictive modelers and other data analysts to work with a small, manageable amount of data about a statistical population to build and run analytical models more quickly, while still producing
accurate findings
Data sampling is a statistical analysis technique used to select, manipulate and analyze a representative
subset of data points to identify patterns and trends in the larger data set being examined
Sampling can be particularly useful with data sets that are too large to efficiently analyze in full  for example, in big data analytics applications or surveys Identifying and analyzing a representative sample is more efficient and cost-effective than surveying the entirety of the data or population
An important consideration, though, is the size of the required data sample and the possibility of introducing a sampling error In some cases, a small sample can reveal the most important information about a data set In others, using a larger sample can increase the likelihood of accurately representing the data as a whole, even though the increased size of the sample may impede ease of manipulation and interpretation
There are many different methods for drawing samples from data; the ideal one depends on the data set and situation Sampling can be
Further variations in probability sampling include:
Simple random sampling: Software is used to randomly select subjects from the whole population
Stratified sampling: Subsets of the data sets or population are created based on a common factor, and samples are randomly collected from each subgroup A sample is drawn from each strata
o EX: In the image below, let's say you need a sample size of 6 Two members from each group (yellow, red, and blue) are selected randomly Make sure to sample proportionally: In this simple example, 1/3 of each group (2/6 yellow, 2/6 red and 2/6 blue) has been sampled If you have one group that's a different size, make sure to adjust your proportions For example, if you had 9 yellow, 3 red and 3 blue, a 5-item sample would consist of 3/9 yellow (ie one third), 1/3 red and 1/3 blue
Cluster sampling: The larger data set is divided into subsets (clusters) based on a defined factor, then a random sampling of clusters is analyzed The sampling unit is the whole cluster; Instead of sampling individuals from within each group, a researcher will study whole clusters
o EX: In the image below, the strata are natural groupings by head color (yellow, red, blue) A sample size of 6 is needed, so two of the complete strata are selected randomly (in this example, groups 2 and 4 are chosen)
Multistage sampling: A more complicated form of cluster sampling, this method also involves dividing the larger population into a number of clusters Second-stage clusters are then broken out based on a secondary factor, and those clusters are then sampled and analyzed This staging could continue as multiple subsets are identified, clustered and analyzed
Systematic sampling: A sample is created by setting an interval at which to extract data from the larger population  for example, selecting every 10th row in a spreadsheet of 200 items to create a sample size of 20 rows to analyze
based on probability, an approach that uses random numbers that
correspond to points in the data set to ensure that there is no correlation between points chosen for the
sample
Sampling can also be
As inclusion is determined by the analyst, it can be more difficult to extrapolate whether the sample accurately represents the larger population than when
probability sampling is used
Non-probability data sampling methods include:
Convenience sampling: Data is collected from an easily accessible and available group
Consecutive sampling: Data is collected from every subject that meets the criteria until the
predetermined sample size is met
Purposive or judgmental sampling: The researcher selects the data to sample based on predefined
criteria
uota sampling: The researcher ensures equal representation within the sample for all subgroups
in the data set or population (random sampling is not used)
Once generated, a sample can be used for predictive analytics For example, a retail business might use data sampling to uncover patterns about customer behavior and predictive modeling to create more effective sales strategies",[]

Imagine you want to predict the price of a house That will depend on some factors, called independent variables, such as location, size, year of construction if we assume there is a linear relationship between these variables and the price (our dependent variable), then our price is predicted by the following function:
The p-value in the table is the minimum  (the significance level) at which the coefficient is relevant The lower the p-value, the more important is the variable in predicting the price Usually we set a 5% level, so that we have a 95% confidentiality that our variable is relevant
The p-value is used as an alternative to rejection points to provide the smallest level of significance at which the null hypothesis would be rejected A smaller p-value means that there is stronger evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis
The coefficient value signifies how much the mean of the dependent variable changes given a one-unit shift in the independent variable while holding other variables in the model constant This property of holding the other variables constant is crucial because it allows you to assess the effect of each variable in isolation from the others
R squared (R2) is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable that's explained by an independent variable or variables in a regression model",[]
4,5 What are the assumptions required for linear regression?,"There are four major assumptions:
There is a linear relationship between the dependent variables and the regressors, meaning the model you are creating actually fits the data,
The errors or residuals (  ) of the data are normally distributed and independent from each other,
There is minimal multicollinearity between explanatory variables, and
Homoscedasticity This means the variance around the regression line is the same for all values
of the predictor variable",[]
5,6 What is a statistical interaction?,"http://icbseverywherecom/blog/mini-lessons-tutorials-and-support-pages/statistical-interactions/
Basically, an interaction is when the effect of one factor (input variable) on the dependent variable (output variable) differs among levels of another factor When two or more independent variables are involved in a research design, there is more to consider than simply the ""main effect"" of each of the independent variables (also termed ""factors"") That is, the effect of one independent variable on the dependent variable of interest may not be the same at all levels of the other independent variable Another way to put this is that the effect of one independent variable may depend on the level of the other independent variable In order to find an interaction, you must have a factorial design, in which the two (or more)
independent variables are ""crossed"" with one another so that there are observations at every combination of levels of the two independent variables EX: stress level and practice to memorize words: together they may have a lower performance",[]
6,7 What is selection bias?,"https://wwwelderresearchcom/blog/selection-bias-in-analytics

The Gaussian distribution is part of the Exponential family of distributions, but there are a lot more of them, with the same sort of ease of use, in many cases, and if the person doing the machine learning has a solid grounding in statistics, they can be utilized where appropriate
Binomial: multiple toss of a coin Bin(n,p):
Bernoulli: Bin(1,p) = Be(p) Poisson: Pois()
the binomial distribution consists of the probabilities of each of
the possible numbers of successes on n trials for independent events that each have a probability of p of
occurring

Clustering, dimension reduction, and density estimation
Selection bias is a kind of error that occurs when the researcher decides what has to be studied It is associated with research where the selection of participants is not random Therefore, some conclusions of the study may not be accurate
The types of selection bias include:
Sampling bias: It is a systematic error due to a non-random sample of a population causing some
members of the population to be less likely to be included than others resulting in a biased
sample
Time interval: A trial may be terminated early at an extreme value (often for ethical reasons), but
the extreme value is likely to be reached by the variable with the largest variance, even if all
variables have a similar mean
Data: When specific subsets of data are chosen to support a conclusion or rejection of bad data
on arbitrary grounds, instead of according to previously stated or generally agreed criteria

9,3 What is bias-variance trade-off?,"Low bias machine learning algorithms  Decision Trees, k-NN and SVM
High bias machine learning algorithms  Linear Regression, Logistic Regression
Bias: Bias is an error introduced in the model due to the oversimplification of the algorithm used (does
not fit the data properly) It can lead to under-fitting
Variance: Variance is error introduced in the model due to a too complex algorithm, it performs very well
in the training set but poorly in the test set It can lead to high sensitivity and overfitting
Possible high variance  polynomial regression
Normally, as you increase the complexity of your model, you will see a reduction in error due to lower bias in the model However, this only happens until a particular point As you continue to make your model more complex, you end up over-fitting your model and hence your model will start suffering from high variance
Bias-Variance trade-off: The goal of any supervised machine learning algorithm is to have low bias and low variance to achieve good prediction performance

20,16 Why is Re-sampling done?,"https://machinelearningmasterycom/statistical-sampling-and-resampling/
Sampling is an active process of gathering observations with the intent of estimating a population variable
Resampling is a methodology of economically using a data sample to improve the accuracy and
Resampling methods, in fact, make use of a Once we have a data sample, it can be used to estimate the population parameter
This is called resampling Statistical resampling methods are procedures that describe how to economically use available data to estimate a population parameter The result can be both a more accurate estimate of the parameter (such as taking the mean of the estimates) and a quantification of the uncertainty of the estimate (such as adding a confidence interval)
Resampling methods are very easy to use, requiring little mathematical knowledge A downside of the methods is that they can be computationally very expensive, requiring tens, hundreds, or even thousands of resamples in order to develop a robust estimate of the population parameter
from which the variability of the quantiles of interest can be assessed without long- winded and error-prone analytical calculation Because this approach involves repeating the original data analysis procedure with many replicate sets of data, these are sometimes called computer-intensive methods Each new subsample from the original data sample is used to estimate the population
The sample of estimated population parameters can then be considered with statistical tools in order to quantify the expected value and variance, providing measures of the uncertainty of the estimate Statistical sampling methods can be used in the selection of a subsample from the original sample
A key difference is that process must be repeated multiple times The problem with this is that there will be some relationship between the samples as observations that will be shared across multiple subsamples This means that the subsamples and the estimated population parameters are not strictly

The problem is that
we only have a single estimate of the population parameter, with little idea of the variability or uncertainty in the estimate One way to address this is by estimating the population parameter multiple times from
The key idea is to resample form the original data  either directly or via a fitted model  to create
replicate datasets,
parameter
identical and independently distributed This has implications for statistical tests performed on the sample of estimated population parameters downstream, ie paired statistical tests may be required
Two commonly used resampling methods that you may encounter are k-fold cross-validation and the bootstrap
Bootstrap Samples are drawn from the dataset with replacement (allowing the same sample to
appear more than once in the sample), where those instances not drawn into the data sample
may be used for the test set
k-fold Cross-Validation A dataset is partitioned into k groups, where each group is given the
opportunity of being used as a held out test set leaving the remaining groups as the training set The k-fold cross-validation method specifically lends itself to use in the evaluation of predictive models that are repeatedly trained on one subset of the data and evaluated on a second held-out
subset of the data
Resampling is done in any of these cases:

21,17 What are the differences between over-fitting and under-fitting?,"In statistics and machine learning, one of the most common tasks is to fit a model to a set of training data, so as to be able to make reliable predictions on general untrained data
In overfitting, a statistical model describes random error or noise instead of the underlying relationship Overfitting occurs when a model is excessively complex, such as having too many parameters relative to the number of observations A model that has been overfitted, has poor predictive performance, as it overreacts to minor fluctuations in the training data
Underfitting occurs when a statistical model or machine learning algorithm cannot capture the underlying trend of the data Underfitting would occur, for example, when fitting a linear model to non-linear data Such a model too would have poor predictive performance",[]

30,27 Why we generally use Soft-max (or sigmoid) non-linearity function as last operation in-network? Why RELU in an inner layer?,"It is because it takes in a vector of real numbers and returns a probability distribution Its definition is as follows Let x be a vector of real numbers (positive, negative, whatever, there are no constraints)

to avoid overfitting
for testing or evaluating the performance of a trained machine learning model, ie evaluating the
predictive power and generalization
Cross-validation is a resampling procedure used to evaluate machine learning models on a limited data sample The procedure has a single parameter called k that refers to the number of groups that a given
data sample is to be split into
Mainly used in backgrounds where the objective is forecast, and one
wants to estimate how accurately a model will accomplish in practice
The general procedure is as follows:
a Take the group as a hold out or test data set
b Take the remaining groups as a training data set
c Fit a model on the training set and evaluate it on the test set
d Retain the evaluation score and discard the model
There is an alternative in Scikit-Learn called Stratified k fold, in which the split is shuffled to make it sure you have a representative sample of each class and a k fold in which you may not have the assurance of it (not good with a very unbalanced dataset)

Naive Bayes methods are a set of supervised learning algorithms based on applying Bayes theorem with the naive assumption of conditional independence between every pair of features given the value of
Bayes theorem states the following relationship, given class variable y and dependent feature vector through :
Using the naive conditional independence assumption that each  is independent: for all , this relationship is simplified to:
Since (,  , ) is constant given the input, we can use the following classification rule:
and we can use Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation to estimate () and (|); the former is then the relative frequency of class  in the training set
The different naive Bayes classifiers differ mainly by the assumptions they make regarding the distribution of (|): can be Bernoulli, Binomial, Gaussian, and so on",[]

The process works as following We define a matrix A with  rows (the single observations of a dataset  in a tabular format, each single row) and  columns, our features For this matrix we construct a variable space with as many dimensions as there are features Each feature represents one coordinate axis For
the class variable
Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical method used in Machine Learning It consists in projectingdata in a higher dimensional space into a lower dimensional space by maximizing
the variance of each dimension
each feature, the length has been standardized according to a scaling criterion, normally by scaling to unit variance
Once plotted all the observations and computed the mean of each variable, that mean will be represented by a point in the center of our plot (the center of gravity) Then, we subtract each observation with the mean, shifting the coordinate system with the center in the origin The best fitting line resulting is the line that best accounts for the shape of the point swarm It represents the maximum variance direction in the data Each observation may be projected onto this line in order to get a coordinate value along the PC-line This value is known as a score The next best-fitting line can be similarly chosen from directions perpendicular to the first
PCA is mostly used as a tool in exploratory data analysis and for making predictive models It is often used to visualize genetic distance and relatedness between populations
https://enwikipediaorg/wiki/Support_vector_machine
Classifying data is a common task in machine learning Suppose some given data points each belong to one of two classes, and the goal is to decide which class a new data point will be in In the case of support- vector machines,
This is called a linear classifier There are many hyperplanes that might classify the data One reasonable choice as the best hyperplane is the one that represents the largest separation, or margin, between the two classes So, we
The best
hyper plane that divides the data is    Wehavendata(,),,(,)andpdifferentfeatures =( ,, )and iseither1or-1 The equation of the hyperplane  is as the set of points x satisfying:
It is determinant to scale the features to a common scale, otherwise the features with a greater
magnitude will weigh more in determining the principal components
Repeating this process yields an orthogonal basis in which different individual dimensions of the data are
uncorrelated These basis vectors are called principal components
a data point is viewed as a p-dimensional vector (a list of  numbers), and we want to
know whether we can separate such points with a (  1)-dimensional hyperplane
choose the hyperplane so that the distance from it to the nearest data point on each side is maximized If such a hyperplane exists, it is known as the maximum-margin hyperplane and the linear classifier it defines

48,10 What are the most known ensemble algorithms?,"https://towardsdatasciencecom/the-ultimate-guide-to-adaboost-random-forests-and-xgboost-7f9327061c4f
The most popular trees are: AdaBoost, Random Forest, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
AdaBoost is best used in a dataset with low noise, when computational complexity or timeliness of results is not a main concern and when there are not enough resources for broader hyperparameter tuning due to lack of time and knowledge of the user
Random forests should not be used when dealing with time series data or any other data where look- ahead bias should be avoided, and the order and continuity of the samples need to be ensured This algorithm can handle noise relatively well, but more knowledge from the user is required to adequately tune the algorithm compared to AdaBoost
The main advantages of XGBoost is its lightning speed compared to other algorithms, such as AdaBoost, and its regularization parameter that successfully reduces variance But even aside from the regularization parameter, this algorithm leverages a learning rate (shrinkage) and subsamples from the features like random forests, which increases its ability to generalize even further However, XGBoost is more difficult to understand, visualize and to tune compared to AdaBoost and random forests There is a multitude of hyperparameters that can be tuned to increase performance

A decision tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm mainly used for Regression and Classification It breaks down a data set into smaller and smaller subsets while at the same time an associated decision tree is incrementally developed The final result is a tree with decision nodes and leaf nodes A decision tree can handle both categorical and numerical data The term Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis is an umbrella term used to refer to both of the above procedures
Some techniques, often called ensemble methods, construct more than one decision tree:
This function is zero if
lies on the correct side of the margin For data on the wrong side of the margin,
the function's value is proportional to the distance from the margin
Boosted trees Incrementally building an ensemble by training each new instance to emphasize the training instances previously mis-modeled A typical example is AdaBoost These can be used for regression-type and classification-type problems
Bootstrap aggregated (or bagged) decision trees, an early ensemble method, builds multiple decision trees by repeatedly resampling training data with replacement, and voting the trees for a consensus prediction
o A random forest classifier is a specific type of bootstrap aggregating
Rotation forest  in which every decision tree is trained by first applying principal component
analysis (PCA) on a random subset of the input features
While less expressive, decision lists are arguably easier to understand than general decision trees due to their added sparsity, permit non-greedy learning methods
and monotonic constraints to be imposed Notable decision tree algorithms include:

49,12 What are Entropy and Information gain in Decision tree algorithm?,"https://wwwsaedsayadcom/decision_treehtm
https://mediumcom/@naeemsunesara/giniscore-entropy-and-information-gain-in-decision-trees- cbc08589852d
There are a lot of algorithms which are employed to build a decision tree, ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3), C45, C50, CART (Classification and Regression Trees) to name a few but at their core all of them tell us what questions to ask and when
A special case of a decision tree is a decision list, which is a one-sided decision tree, so that every internal node has exactly 1 leaf node and exactly 1 internal node as a child (except for the bottommost node,
whose only child is a single leaf node)
The below table has color and diameter of a fruit and the label tells the name of the fruit How do we build
a decision tree to classify the fruits?
Here is how we will build the tree We will start with a node which will ask a true or false question to split the data into two The two resulting nodes will each ask a true or false question again to split the data further and so on
There are 2 main things to consider with the above approach:
Which is the best question to ask at each node
When do we stop splitting the data further?
Lets start building the tree with the first or the topmost node There is a list of possible questions which can be asked The first node can ask the following questions:
Is the color green?
Is the color yellow?
Is the color red?
Is the diameter  3?
Is the diameter  1?
Of these possible set of questions, which one is the best to ask so that our data is split into two sets after the first node? Remember we are trying to split or classify our data into separate classes
for example if we ask the question for the above data, Is the color green? our data will be split into two sets one of which will be pure the other will have a mixed set of labels If we assign a label to a mixed set, we have higher chances of being
incorrect But how do we measure this impurity?
Gini Impurity and Information Gain - CART
CART (Classification and Regression Trees)  uses Gini Index (Classification) as metric
should be such that our data is partitioned into as unmixed or pure classes as possible An impure set or
Our question
class here refers to one which has many different types of objects
The Gini Impurity (GI) metric measures the homogeneity of a set of items The lowest possible value of GI is 00 The maximum value of GI depends on the particular problem being investigated but gets close to 10
Suppose for example you have 12 items  apples, grapes, lemons If there are 0 apples, 0 grapes, 12 lemons, then you have minimal impurity (this is good for decision trees) and GI = 00 But if you have 4 apples, 4 grapes, 4 lemons, you have maximum impurity and it turns out that GI = 0667
Ill show example calculations
Maximum GI: Apples, Grapes, Lemons
When the number of items is evenly distributed, as in the example above, you have maximum GI but the exact value depends on how many items there are A bit less than maximum GI:
In the example above, the items are not quite evenly distributed, and the GI is slightly less (which is better when used for decision trees) Minimum GI:
The Gini index is not at all the same as a different metric called the Gini coefficient The Gini impurity metric can be used when creating a decision tree but there are alternatives, including Entropy Information gain The advantage of GI is its simplicity
Information Gain
Information gain is another metric which tells us how much a question unmixes the labels at a node Mathematically it is just a difference between impurity values before splitting the data at a node and the weighted average of the impurity after the split For instance, if we go back to our data of apples, lemons and grapes and ask the question Is the color Green?
The information gain by asking this question is 0144 Similarly, we can ask another question from the set of possible questions split the data and compute information gain This is also called (Recursive Binary Splitting)
The question where we have the highest information gain Is diameter  3? is the best question to ask Note that the information gain is same for the question Is the color red? we just picked the first one at random
Repeating the same method at the child node we can complete the tree Note that no further questions can be asked which would increase the information gain
Also note that the rightmost leaf which says 50% Apple & 50% lemon means that this class cannot be divided further, and this branch can tell an apple or a lemon with 50% probability For the grape and apple branches we stop asking further questions since the Gini Impurity is 0 for those
Entropy and Information Gain  ID3
ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3)  uses Entropy function and Information gain as metrics
If the sample is completely homogeneous the entropy is zero and if the sample is an equally divided it has
entropy of one
To build a decision tree, we need to calculate two types of entropy using frequency tables as follows:
a) Entropy using the frequency table of one attribute:
b) Entropy using the frequency table of two attributes:
Information Gain
The information gain is based on the decrease in entropy after a dataset is split on an attribute Constructing a decision tree is all about finding attribute that returns the highest information gain (ie,
the most homogeneous branches)
Step 1: Calculate entropy of the target
Step 2: The dataset is then split on the different attributes The entropy for each branch is calculated Then it is added proportionally, to get total entropy for the split The resulting entropy is subtracted from the entropy before the split The result is the Information Gain or decrease in entropy
Step 3: Choose attribute with the largest information gain as the decision node, divide the dataset by its branches and repeat the same process on every branch
Step 4a: A branch with entropy of 0 is a leaf node
Step 4b: A branch with entropy more than 0 needs further splitting
Step 5: The ID3 algorithm is run recursively on the non-leaf branches, until all data is classified",[]
50,13 What is pruning in Decision Tree?,"So, when we remove sub- nodes of a decision node, this process is called pruning or opposite process of splitting
Logistic Regression often referred to as the logit model is a technique to predict the binary outcome from a linear combination of predictor variables Since we are interested in a probability outcome, a line does not fit the model Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm that works by trying to learn a function
Pruning is a technique in machine learning and search algorithms that reduces the size of decision trees
by removing sections of the tree that provide little power to classify instances
that approximates ( |) It makes the central assumption that (| ) can be approximated as a sigmoid function applied to a linear combination of input features
For example, if you want to predict whether a particular political leader will win the election or not In this case, the outcome of prediction is binary ie 0 or 1 (Win/Lose) The predictor variables here would be the amount of money spent for election campaigning of a particular candidate, the amount of time spent in campaigning, etc",[]

preferences or ratings that a user would give to a product

If there are no patterns identified, then the missing values can be substituted with mean or median values (imputation) or they can simply be ignored Assigning a default value which can be mean, minimum or maximum value Getting into the data is important
If it is a categorical variable, the default value is assigned The missing value is assigned a default value If you have a distribution of data coming, for normal distribution give the mean value
If 80% of the values for a variable are missing, then you can answer that you would be dropping the variable instead of treating the missing values",[]
59,23 How will you define the number of clusters in a clustering algorithm?,"https://stackabusecom/hierarchical-clustering-with-python-and-scikit-learn/
Though the Clustering Algorithm is not specified, this question is mostly in reference to K-Means clustering where K defines the number of clusters The objective of clustering is to group similar entities in a way that the entities within a group are similar to each other, but the groups are different from each other
For example, the following image shows three different groups
Within Sum of squares is generally used to explain the homogeneity within a cluster If you plot WSS (as the sum of the squared distance between each member of the cluster and its centroid) for a range of number of clusters, you will get the plot shown below
The Graph is generally known as Elbow Curve
Red circled a point in above graph ie Number of Cluster = 3 is the point after which you dont see
any decrement in WSS
This point is known as the bending point and taken as K in K  Means
This is the widely used approach but few data scientists also use Hierarchical clustering first to create dendrograms and identify the distinct groups from there
The algorithm starts by finding the two points that are closest to each other on the basis of Euclidean distance If we look back at Graph1, we can see that points 2 and 3 are closest to each other while points 7 and 8 are closes to each other Therefore a cluster will be formed between these two points first In Graph2, you can see that the dendograms have been created joining points 2 with 3, and 8 with 7 The vertical height of the dendogram shows the Euclidean distances between points From Graph2, it can be seen that Euclidean distance between points 8 and 7 is greater than the distance between point 2 and 3 The next step is to join the cluster formed by joining two points to the next nearest cluster or point which in turn results in another cluster If you look at Graph1, point 4 is closest to cluster of point 2 and 3, therefore in Graph2 dendrogram is generated by joining point 4 with dendrogram of point 2 and 3 This process continues until all the points are joined together to form one big cluster
Once one big cluster is formed, the longest vertical distance without any horizontal line passing through it is selected and a horizontal line is drawn through it The number of vertical lines this newly created horizontal line passes is equal to number of clusters Take a look at the following plot:
We can see that the largest vertical distance without any horizontal line passing through it is represented by blue line So we draw a new horizontal red line that passes through the blue line Since it crosses the blue line at two points, therefore the number of clusters will be 2 Basically the horizontal line is a threshold, which defines the minimum distance required to be a separate cluster If we draw a line further down, the threshold required to be a new cluster will be decreased and more clusters will be formed as see in the image below:
In the above plot, the horizontal line passes through four vertical lines resulting in four clusters: cluster of points 6,7,8 and 10, cluster of points 3,2,4 and points 9 and 5 will be treated as single point clusters",[]
60,24 What is Ensemble Learning?,"alone
In statistics and machine learning, ensemble methods use multiple learning algorithms to obtain better predictive performance than could be obtained from any of the constituent learning algorithms
Ensembles are a divide-and-conquer approach used to improve performance The main principle
behind ensemble methods is that a group of weak learners can come together to form a strong
learner Each classifier, individually, is a weak learner, while all the classifiers taken together are a
strong learner
https://mediumcom/@ruhi3929/bagging-and-boosting-method-c036236376eb
Ensemble learning has many types but two more popular ensemble learning techniques are mentioned below
Bagging
Pros
Bagging method helps when we face variance or overfitting in the model It provides an environment to deal with variance by using N learners of same size on same algorithm
During the sampling of train data, there are many observations which overlaps So, the combination of these learners helps in overcoming the high variance
Bagging uses Bootstrap sampling method (Bootstrappingis any test or metric that uses random sampling with replacement and falls under the broader class of resampling methods)
Cons
Bagging is not helpful in case of bias or underfitting in the data
Bagging ignores the value with the highest and the lowest result which may have a wide difference
and provides an average result
Boosting
Pros
Boosting technique takes care of the weightage of the higher accuracy sample and lower accuracy sample and then gives the combined results
Net error is evaluated in each learning steps It works good with interactions
Boosting technique helps when we are dealing with bias or underfitting in the data set
Multiple boosting techniques are available For example: AdaBoost, LPBoost, XGBoost,
GradientBoost, BrownBoost
Cons
Boosting technique often ignores overfitting or variance issues in the data set
Bagging tries to implement similar learners on small sample populations and then takes a mean of all the predictions In generalized bagging, you can use different learners on different population As you expect
this helps us to reduce the variance error
Boosting is an iterative technique which adjusts the weight of an observation based on the last classification If an observation was classified incorrectly, it tries to increase the weight of this observation and vice versa Boosting in general decreases the bias error and builds strong predictive models However,
they may over fit on the training data
It increases the complexity of the classification
Time and computation can be a bit expensive
There are multiple areas where Bagging and Boosting technique is used to boost the accuracy
Banking: Loan defaulter prediction, fraud transaction

outlier values
It is a type of ensemble learning method, where a group of weak models combine to form a powerful model The random forest starts with a standard machine learning technique called a decision tree which, in ensemble terms, corresponds to our weak learner In a decision tree, an input is entered at the top and as it traverses down the tree the data gets bucketed into smaller and smaller sets
trees",[]
62,27 How Do You Work Towards a Random Forest?,"https://blogcitizennetcom/blog/2012/11/10/random-forests-ensembles-and-performance-metrics
The underlying principle of this technique is that several weak learners combined to provide a keen learner Here is how such a system is trained for some number of trees T:
a For some number m (see below), m predictor variables are selected at random from all
the predictor variables
b The predictor variable that provides the best split, according to some objective function,
is used to do a binary split on that node
c At the next node, choose another m variables at random from all predictor variables and
do the same
Depending upon the value of m, there are three slightly different systems:
In Random Forest, we grow multiple trees as opposed to a single tree To classify a new object based on attributes, each tree gives a classification The forest chooses the classification having the most votes (Over all the trees in the forest) and in case of regression, it takes the average of outputs by different
Random splitter selection:  = 1
Breimans bagger:  = total number of predictor variables ()
Random forest:   number of predictor variables
o Brieman suggests three possible values for :  , , 2
When a new input is entered into the system, it is run down all of the trees The result may either be an average or weighted average of all of the terminal nodes that are reached, or, in the case of categorical variables, a voting majority
Note that:
With a large number of predictors (  0), the eligible predictor set () will be quite different
from node to node
The greater the inter-tree correlation, the greater the random forest error rate, so one pressure
on the model is to have the trees as uncorrelated as possible
As m goes down, both inter-tree correlation and the strength of individual trees go down So some
optimal value of m must be discovered
Strengths: Random forest runtimes are quite fast, and they are able to deal with unbalanced and
missing data
Weaknesses: Random Forest used for regression cannot predict beyond the range in the training
data, and that they may over-fit data sets that are particularly noisy Of course, the best test of
any algorithm is how well it works upon your own data set",[]

number of tests
A Box-Cox transformation is a way to transform non-normal dependent variables into a normal shape Normality is an important assumption for many statistical techniques, if your data isnt normal, applying a Box-Cox means that you are able to run a broader number of tests The Box-Cox transformation is named after statisticians George Box and Sir David Roxbee Cox who collaborated on a 1964 paper and developed the technique",[]

68,2 What is the difference between machine learning and deep learning?,"https://parsersme/deep-learning-machine-learning-whats-the-difference/
Machine learning is a field of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed Machine learning can be categorized in the following four categories
Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks
The main difference between deep learning and machine learning is due to the way data is presented in the system Machine learning algorithms almost always require structured data, while deep learning networks rely on layers of ANN (artificial neural networks)
Machine learning algorithms are designed to learn to act by understanding labeled data and then use it to produce new results with more datasets However, when the result is incorrect, there is a need to teach them Because machine learning algorithms require bulleted data, they are not suitable for solving complex queries that involve a huge amount of data
Deep learning networks do not require human intervention, as multilevel layers in neural networks place data in a hierarchy of different concepts, which ultimately learn from their own mistakes However, even they can be wrong if the data quality is not good enough
Data decides everything It is the quality of the data that ultimately determines the quality of the result
Both of these subsets of AI are somehow connected to data, which makes it possible to represent a certain form of intelligence However, you should be aware that deep learning requires much more data than a traditional machine learning algorithm The reason for this is that deep learning networks can identify different elements in neural network layers only when more than a million data points interact Machine learning algorithms, on the other hand, are capable of learning by pre-programmed criteria",[]

76,10 What Will Happen If the Learning Rate Is Set inaccurately (Too Low or Too High)?,"When your learning rate is too low, training of the model will progress very slowly as we are making minimal updates to the weights It will take many updates before reaching the minimum point

78,12 What Are the Different Layers on CNN?,"https://towardsdatasciencecom/basics-of-the-classic-cnn-a3dce1225add
Also referred to as loss or error, cost function is a measure to evaluate how good your models performance is Its used to compute the error of the output layer during backpropagation We push that
error backwards through the neural network and use that during the different training functions
The Convolutional neural networks are regularized versions of multilayer perceptron (MLP) They were
developed based on the working of the neurons of the animal visual cortex
Lets say we have a color image in JPG form and its size is 480 x 480 The representative array will be 480 x 480 x 3 Each of these numbers is given a value from 0 to 255 which describes the pixel intensity at that point RGB intensity values of the image are visualized by the computer for processing
The objective of using the CNN:
It works similar to how our brain works When we look at a picture of a dog, we can classify it as such if the picture has identifiable features such as paws or 4 legs In a similar way, the computer is able to perform image classification by looking for low-level features such as edges and curves and then building up to more abstract concepts through a series of convolutional layers The computer uses low-level features obtained
at the initial levels to generate high-level features such as paws or eyes to identify the object There are four layers in CNN:
feature map Stride = how much you slide, and you get the max of the    matrix Fully Connected Layer  this layer recognizes and classifies the objects in the image
The idea is that you give the computer this array of numbers and it will output numbers that describe the
probability of the image being a certain class (80 for a cat, 15 for a dog, 05 for a bird, etc)
the layer that performs a convolutional operation, creating several smaller
picture windows to go over the data
it brings non-linearity to the network and converts all the negative
pixels to zero The output is a rectified feature map It follows each convolutional layer
pooling is a down-sampling operation that reduces the dimensionality of the
Convolution Operation
First Layer:
The image is resized to an optimal size and is fed as input to the convolutional layer Let us consider the input as 32x32x3 array of pixel values
Let the dimensions of the kernel of the filter be 5x5x3
The multiplications are summed up generating a single number for that particular receptive field and hence for sliding the kernel a total of 784 numbers are mapped to 28x28 array known as the feature map
High-level Perspective
Let us take a kernel of size (7x7x3) for understanding Each of the kernels is considered to be a feature identifier, hence say that our filter will be a curve detector
The original image and the visualization of the kernel on the image
The sum of the multiplication value that is generated is = 4  (50  30)
Now when the kernel moves to the other part of the image
The sum of the multiplication value that is generated is = 0 (small number)
The use of the small and the large value
In the picture, we can see some examples of actual visualizations of the filters of the first conv layer of a trained network Nonetheless, the main argument remains the same
Sequential convolutional layers after the first one
other filters for lines that curve to the left or for straight edges The more filters, the greater the
depth of the activation map, and the more information we have about the input volume
The filters on the
first layer convolve around the input image and activate (or compute high values) when the
specific feature it is looking for is in the input volume
Pooling Operation
As you go through the network and go through more convolutional layers, you
get activation maps that represent more and more complex features
By the end of the network, you may have some filters that activate when there is handwriting in
the image, filters that activate when they see pink objects, etc
It consists in getting the largest number out of a matrix to get the most important number and reduce the dimention
Max Pooling example
Classification
Training
We know kernels also known as feature identifiers, used for identification of specific features But how the kernels are initialized with the specific weights or how do the filters know what values to have
Hence comes the important step of training
The Forward Pass
For the first epoch or iteration of the training the initial kernels of the first convolutional layer are initialized with random values Thus, after the first iteration output will be something like [1111111111], which does not give preference to any class as the kernels dont have specific weights
The Loss Function
The training involves images along with labels, hence the label for the digit 3 will be [0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0], whereas the output after a first epoch is very different, hence we will calculate loss (MSE  Mean Squared Error)
The objective is to minimize the loss, which is an optimization problem in calculus It involves trying to adjust the weights to reduce the loss
The Backward Pass
most strongly correlate to a particular class and has particular weights so that when you compute the products between the weights and the previous layer, you get the correct probabilities for the
an FC layer looks at what high level features
different classes
The training process is also known as backpropagation, which
is further separated into 4 distinct sections or processes
Forward Pass
Loss Function
Backward Pass
Weight Update
It involves determining which weights contributed most to the loss and finding ways to adjust them so that the loss decreases
The weights update
This is where the weights of the kernel are updated using the following equation
Here the Learning Rate is chosen by the programmer Larger value of the learning rate indicates much larger steps towards optimization of steps and larger time to convolve to an optimized weight
Testing
Finally, to see whether or not our CNN works, we have a different set of images and labels (cant double dip between training and test!) and pass the images through the CNN We compare the outputs to the ground truth and see if our network works!",[]

80,14 What are Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)?,"https://towardsdatasciencecom/recurrent-neural-networks-d4642c9bc7ce
RNNs are a type of artificial neural networks designed to recognize the pattern from the sequence of data such as Time series, stock market and government agencies etc
It is computed using  (or ), where L is the loss and the W is the weights of
the corresponding kernel
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) add an interesting twist to basic neural networks A vanilla neural network takes in a fixed size vector as input which limits its usage in situations that involve a series type
input with no predetermined size
RNNs are designed to take a series of input with no predetermined limit on size One could ask whats the big deal, I can call a regular NN repeatedly too?
Sure can, but the series part of the input means something A single input item from the series is related to others and likely has an influence on its neighbors Otherwise it's just many inputs, not a series input (duh!)
Note: Basic feed forward networks remember things too, but they remember things they learnt during training For example, an image classifier learns what a 1 looks like during training and then uses that knowledge to classify things in production
Recurrent Neural Network remembers the past and its decisions are influenced by what it has learnt from
the past
While RNNs learn similarly while training, in addition, they remember things learnt from prior input(s) while generating output(s) RNNs can take one or more input vectors and produce one or more output vectors and the output(s) are influenced not just by weights applied on inputs like a regular NN, but also
by a hidden state vector representing the context based on prior input(s)/output(s)
could produce a different output depending on previous inputs in the series
So, the same input
In summary, in a vanilla neural network, a fixed size input vector is transformed into a fixed size output vector Such a network becomes recurrent when you repeatedly apply the transformations to a series of given input and produce a series of output vectors There is no pre-set limitation to the size of the vector And, in addition to generating the output which is a function of the input and hidden state, we
update the hidden state itself based on the input and use it in processing the next input
Parameter Sharing
You might have noticed another key difference between Figure 1 and Figure 3 In the earlier, multiple different weights are applied to the different parts of an input item generating a hidden layer neuron, which in turn is transformed using further weights to produce an output There seems to be a lot of weights in play here Whereas in Figure 3, we seem to be applying the same weights over and over again to different items in the input series
I am sure you are quick to point out that we are kind of comparing apples and oranges here The first figure deals with a single input whereas the second figure represents multiple inputs from a series But nevertheless, intuitively speaking, as the number of inputs increase, shouldnt the number of weights in play increase as well? Are we losing some versatility and depth in Figure 3?
Perhaps we are We are sharing parameters across inputs in Figure 3 If we dont share parameters across inputs, then it becomes like a vanilla neural network where each input node requires weights of their own This introduces the constraint that the length of the input has to be fixed and that makes it impossible to leverage a series type input where the lengths differ and is not always known
But what we seemingly lose in value here, we gain back by introducing the hidden state that links one input to the next
The hidden state captures the relationship that neighbors might have with each other
in a serial input and it keeps changing in every step, and thus effectively every input undergoes a different
transition!
Image classifying CNNs have become so successful because the 2D convolutions are an effective form of parameter sharing where each convolutional filter basically extracts the presence or absence of a feature
in an image which is a function of not just one pixel but also of its surrounding neighbor pixels
In other words, the success of CNNs and RNNs can be attributed to the concept of parameter sharing
which is fundamentally an effective way of leveraging the relationship between one input item and its
surrounding neighbors in a more intrinsic fashion compared to a vanilla neural network
Deep RNNs
While its good that the introduction of hidden state enabled us to effectively identify the relationship between the inputs, is there a way we can make an RNN deep and gain the multi-level abstractions and representations we gain through depth in a typical neural network?
Here are four possible ways to add depth
Bidirectional RNNs
Sometimes its not just about learning from the past to predict the future, but we also need to look into the future to fix the past In speech recognition and handwriting recognition tasks, where there could be
considerable ambiguity given just one part of the input, we often need to know whats coming next to
better understand the context and detect the present
This does introduce the obvious challenge of how much into the future we need to look into, because if
And in cases like speech recognition, waiting till an entire sentence is spoken might make for a less compelling use case Whereas for NLP tasks, where the inputs tend to be available, we can likely consider entire sentences all at once Also, depending on the application, if the sensitivity to immediate and closer neighbors is higher than
inputs that come further away, a variant that looks only into a limited future/past can be modeled
Recursive Neural Network
Recursive Neural Networks are a more general form of Recurrent Neural Networks It can operate on any hierarchical tree structure
we have to wait to see all inputs then the entire operation will become costly
A recurrent neural network parses the inputs in a sequential fashion A recursive neural network is similar to the extent that the transitions are repeatedly applied to inputs, but not necessarily in a sequential
fashion
Parsing through input nodes, combining child nodes into parent nodes
and combining them with other child/parent nodes to create a tree like structure Recurrent Neural Networks do the same, but the structure there is strictly linear ie weights are applied on the first input
node, then the second, third and so on
But this raises questions pertaining to the structure How do we decide that? If the structure is fixed like in Recurrent Neural Networks then the process of training, backprop, makes sense in that they are similar to a regular neural network But if the structure isnt fixed, is that learnt as well?
Encoder Decoder Sequence to Sequence RNNs
Another key difference in this arrangement is that the length of the input sequence and the length of the output sequence need not necessarily be the same
LSTMs
LSTM is not a different variant of RNN architecture, but rather it introduces changes to how we compute outputs and hidden state using the inputs
There are variants of LSTMs including GRUs that utilize the gates in different manners to address the problem of long-term
dependencies",[]
81,15 How Does an LSTM Network Work?,"http://karpathygithubio/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness
https://colahgithubio/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/
Encoder Decoder or Sequence to Sequence RNNs are used a lot in translation services The basic idea is that there are two RNNs, one an encoder that keeps updating its hidden state and produces a final single Context output This is then fed to the decoder, which translates this context to a sequence of outputs
In a vanilla RNN, the input and the hidden state are simply passed through a single tanh layer LSTM (Long- Short-Term Memory) networks improve on this simple transformation and introduces additional gates and a cell state, such that it fundamentally addresses the problem of keeping or resetting context, across
sentences and regardless of the distance between such context resets
Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a special kind of recurrent neural network capable of learning long-
term dependencies, remembering information for long periods as its default behavior
steps in an LSTM network:
Step 1: The network decides what to forget and what to remember
Step 2: It selectively updates cell state values
Step 3: The network decides what part of the current state makes it to the output
Recurrent Neural Networks
For example, imagine you want to classify what kind of event is happening at every point in a movie Its unclear how a traditional
neural network could use its reasoning about previous events in the film to inform later ones
Recurrent Neural Networks have loops
In the above diagram, a chunk of neural network, A, looks at some input  and outputs a value h A loop allows information to be passed from one step of the network to the next
These loops make recurrent neural networks seem kind of mysterious However, if you think a bit more, it turns out that they arent all that different than a normal neural network
Recurrent neural networks address this issue They are networks with loops in them, allowing information
to persist
what happens if we unroll the loop:
There are three
Humans dont start their thinking from scratch every second As you read this essay, you understand each word based on your understanding of previous words You dont throw everything away and start thinking
from scratch again Your thoughts have persistence
Traditional neural networks cant do this, and it seems like a major shortcoming
A recurrent neural network
can be thought of as multiple copies of the same network, each passing a message to a successor
Consider
An unrolled recurrent neural network
This chain-like nature reveals that recurrent neural networks are intimately related to sequences and lists Theyre the natural architecture of neural network to use for such data
And they certainly are used! In the last few years, there have been incredible success applying RNNs to a variety of problems: speech recognition, language modeling, translation, image captioning
Essential to these successes is the use of LSTMs, a very special kind of recurrent neural network which works, for many tasks, much better than the standard version Almost all exciting results based on recurrent neural networks are achieved with them
The Problem of Long-Term Dependencies
One of the appeals of RNNs is the idea that they might be able to connect previous information to the present task, such as using previous video frames might inform the understanding of the present frame If RNNs could do this, theyd be extremely useful But can they? It depends
Sometimes, we only need to look at recent information to perform the present task For example, consider a language model trying to predict the next word based on the previous ones If we are trying to predict the last word in the clouds are in the sky, we dont need any further context  its pretty obvious the next word is going to be sky In such cases, where the gap between the relevant information and the place that its needed is small, RNNs can learn to use the past information
But there are also cases where we need more context Consider trying to predict the last word in the text I grew up in France I speak fluent French Recent information suggests that the next word is probably the name of a language, but if we want to narrow down which language, we need the context of France, from further back Its entirely possible for the gap between the relevant information and the point where it is needed to become very large
Unfortunately, as that gap grows, RNNs become unable to learn to connect the information
In theory, RNNs are absolutely capable of handling such long-term dependencies A human could carefully pick parameters for them to solve toy problems of this form Sadly, in practice, RNNs dont seem to be able to learn them Thankfully, LSTMs dont have this problem!
LSTM Networks
Long Short-Term Memory networks  usually just called LSTMs  are a special kind of RNN, capable of learning long-term dependencies They work tremendously well on a large variety of problems and are now widely used
All recurrent neural networks have the form of a chain of repeating modules of neural network In standard RNNs, this repeating module will have a very simple structure, such as a single tanh layer
The repeating module in a standard RNN contains a single layer
LSTMs are explicitly designed to avoid the long-term dependency problem Remembering information for
long periods of time is practically their default behavior, not something they struggle to learn!
LSTMs also have this chain like structure, but the repeating module has a different structure Instead of
having a single neural network layer, there are four, interacting in a very special way
The repeating module in an LSTM contains four interacting layers
In the above diagram, each line carries an entire vector, from the output of one node to the inputs of others The pink circles represent pointwise operations, like vector addition, while the yellow boxes are learned neural network layers Lines merging denote concatenation, while a line forking denotes its content being copied and the copies going to different locations
The Core Idea Behind LSTMs
The key to LSTMs is the cell state, the horizontal line running through the top of the diagram
The cell state is kind of like a conveyor belt It runs straight down the entire chain, with only some minor linear interactions Its very easy for information to just flow along it unchanged
The LSTM does have the ability to remove or add information to the cell state, carefully regulated by
structures called gates
Gates are a way to optionally let information through They are composed out of a sigmoid neural net
layer and a pointwise multiplication operation
The sigmoid layer outputs numbers between zero and one, describing how much of each component should be let through A value of zero means let nothing through, while a value of one means let everything through!
An LSTM has three of these gates, to protect and control the cell state",[]
82,16 What Is a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)?,"https://towardsdatasciencecom/what-the-hell-is-perceptron-626217814f53
As in Neural Networks, MLPs have an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer It has the same structure as a single layer perceptron with one or more hidden layers
Perceptron is a single layer neural network and a multi-layer perceptron is called Neural Networks
A (single layer) perceptron is a single layer neural network that works as a linear binary classifier Being a single layer neural network, it can be trained without the use of more advanced algorithms like back propagation and instead can be trained by ""stepping towards"" your error in steps specified by a learning rate When someone says perceptron, I usually think of the single layer version
A single layer perceptron can classify only linear separable classes with binary output {0,1} or {-1,1}, but
MLP can classify nonlinear classes
required values like {0, 1} or {-1, 1}
The activation functions are used to map the input between the
Except for the input layer, each node in the other layers uses a nonlinear activation function This means the input layers, the data coming in, and the activation function is based upon all nodes and weights being added together, producing the output
Usually, RELU is in hidden layers (it does not classify), and Soft-max or tanh is in output layers
Lets first explain what a gradient is A gradient is a mathematical function When calculated on a point of a function, it gives the hyperplane (or slope) of the directions in which the function increases more The gradient vector can be interpreted as the ""direction and rate of fastest increase"" If the gradient of a
MLP uses a supervised learning method called backpropagation
In backpropagation, the neural network calculates the error with the help of cost function It propagates
this error backward from where it came (adjusts the weights to train the model more accurately)
function is non-zero at a point p, the direction of the gradient is the direction in which the function increases most quickly from p, and the magnitude of the gradient is the rate of increase in that direction
Gradient descent is a first-order iterative optimization algorithm for finding the minimum of a function
So, the idea is to pass the training set through the hidden layers of the neural network and then update the parameters of the layers by computing the gradients using the training samples from the training dataset
Think of it like this Suppose a man is at top of the valley and he wants to get to the bottom of the valley So, he goes down the slope He decides his next position based on his current position and stops when he gets to the bottom of the valley which was his goal",[]
83,18 What is exploding gradients?,"https://machinelearningmasterycom/exploding-gradients-in-neural-networks/
While training an RNN, if you see exponentially growing (very large) error gradients which accumulate and result in very large updates to neural network model weights during training, theyre known as exploding gradients At an extreme, the values of weights can become so large as to overflow and result in NaN values
This has the effect of your model is unstable and unable to learn from your training data
Further, the gradient is the zero vector at a point if and only if it is a stationary point (where the derivative
vanishes)
In DS, it simply measures the change in all weights with regard to the change in error, as we are partially
derivating by w the loss function
The goal of the gradient descent is to minimize a given function which, in our case, is the loss function of
the neural network To achieve this goal, it performs two steps iteratively
amount
The explosion occurs through exponential growth by repeatedly multiplying gradients through the
network layers that have values larger than 10
There are some subtle signs that you may be suffering from exploding gradients during the training of your network, such as:
The model is unable to get traction on your training data (eg poor loss)
The model is unstable, resulting in large changes in loss from update to update
Solutions
a In deep neural networks, exploding gradients may be addressed by redesigning the
network to have fewer layers There may also be some benefit in using a smaller batch
size while training the network
b In RNNs, updating across fewer prior time steps during training, called truncated
Backpropagation through time, may reduce the exploding gradient problem",[]
84,19 What is vanishing gradients?,"While training an RNN, your slope can become either too small; this makes the training difficult When the slope is too small, the problem is known as a Vanishing Gradient It leads to long training times, poor performance, and low accuracy
Hyperbolic tangent and Sigmoid/Soft-max suffer vanishing gradient
RNNs suffer vanishing gradient, LSTM no (so it is perfect to predict stock prices) In fact, the
propagation of error through previous layers makes the gradient get smaller so the weights are not updated
The model loss goes to NaN during training
The model weights quickly become very large during training
The error gradient values are consistently above 10 for each node and layer during training
gradient clipping Specifically, the values of the error gradient are
checked against a threshold value and clipped or set to that threshold value if the error gradient
exceeds the threshold

training
Backpropagation is a training algorithm used for neural network In this method, we update the weights of each layer from the last layer recursively, with the formula:
It has the following steps:
Forward Propagation of Training Data (initializing weights with random or pre-assigned values)

Stochastic Gradient Descent: In Batch Gradient Descent we were considering all the examples for every step of Gradient Descent But what if our dataset is very huge Deep learning models crave for data The more the data the more chances of a model to be good Suppose our dataset has 5 million examples, then just to take one step the model will have to calculate the gradients of all the 5 million examples This does not seem an efficient way To tackle this problem, we have Stochastic Gradient Descent In Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), we consider just one example at a time to take a single step We do the following steps in one epoch for SGD:
Since we are considering just one example at a time the cost will fluctuate over the training examples and it will not necessarily decrease But in the long run, you will see the cost decreasing with fluctuations Also, because the cost is so fluctuating, it will never reach the minimum, but it will keep dancing around it SGD can be used for larger datasets It converges faster when the dataset is large as it causes updates to the parameters more frequently
Batch Gradient Descent: all the training data is taken into consideration to take a single step We take the average of the gradients of all the training examples and then use that mean gradient to update our parameters So thats just one step of gradient descent in one epoch Batch Gradient Descent is great for convex or relatively smooth error manifolds In this case, we move somewhat directly towards an optimum solution The graph of cost vs epochs is also quite smooth because we are averaging over all the gradients of training data for a single step The cost keeps on decreasing over the epochs
Mini-batch Gradient Descent: Its one of the most popular optimization algorithms Its a variant of Stochastic Gradient Descent and here instead of single training example, mini batch of samples is used
But, since in SGD we use only one example at a time, we cannot implement the vectorized implementation on it This can slow down the computations To tackle this problem, a mixture of Neither we use all the dataset all at once nor we use the
single example at a time
Doing this helps us achieve the advantages of both the former variants we saw So, after creating the mini-batches of fixed size, we do the following steps in one
epoch:
Batch Gradient Descent can be used for smoother curves SGD can be used when the dataset is
large Batch Gradient Descent converges directly to minima SGD converges faster for larger datasets
Batch Gradient Descent and SGD is used
We use a batch of a fixed number of training examples which is less than the
actual dataset and call it a mini-batch
Just like SGD, the average cost over the epochs in mini-batch gradient descent fluctuates because we are averaging a small number of examples at a time So, when we are using the mini-batch gradient descent we are updating our parameters frequently as well as we can use vectorized implementation for faster computations",[]

The patterns can be studied by drawing conclusions using mean, median, and mode, dispersion or range, minimum, maximum, etc You can start describing the data and using it to guess what the price of the house will be",[]
96,4 What are the feature selection methods used to select the right variables?,"There are two main methods for feature selection
Filter Methods
This involves:
Linear discrimination analysis
ANOVA
Chi-Square
The best analogy for selecting features is ""bad data in, bad answer out"" When we're limiting or selecting the features, it's all about cleaning up the data coming in
Wrapper Methods
This involves:
Forward Selection: We test one feature at a time and keep adding them until we get a good
fit
Backward Selection: We test all the features and start removing them to see what works
better
Recursive Feature Elimination: Recursively looks through all the different features and how
they pair together
Wrapper methods are very labor-intensive, and high-end computers are needed if a lot of data analysis is performed with the wrapper method
The code is shown below:
for x in range(51):
if x % 3 == 0 and x % 5 == 0: print(fizzbuzz)
elif x % 3 == 0: print(fizz)
elif x % 5 == 0: print(buzz)
else:
print(fizzbuzz)",[]
97,6 You are given a data set consisting of variables with more than 30 percent missing values How will you deal with them?,"If the data set is large, we can just simply remove the rows with missing data values It is the quickest way; we use the rest of the data to predict the values
For smaller data sets, we can impute missing values with the mean, median, or average of the rest of the data using pandas data frame in python There are different ways to do so, such as:
dfmean(), dffillna(mean)
Other option of imputation is using KNN for numeric or classification values (as KNN just uses k closest values to impute the missing value)",[]
98,"7 For the given points, how will you calculate the Euclidean distance in Python?","plot1 = [1,3]
plot2 = [2,5]
The Euclidean distance can be calculated as follows:

99,8 What are dimensionality reduction and its benefits?,"Dimensionality reduction refers to the process of converting a data set with vast dimensions into data with fewer dimensions (fields) to convey similar information concisely
This reduction helps in compressing data and reducing storage space It also reduces computation time as fewer dimensions lead to less computing It removes redundant features; for example, there's no point in storing a value in two different units (meters and inches)",[]
100,9 How will you calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the following 3x3 matrix?,Determinant of   1 and solve to find,[]

103,12 'People who bought this also bought' recommendations seen on Amazon are a result of which algorithm?,"The recommendation engine is accomplished with collaborative filtering Collaborative filtering explains the behavior of other users and their purchase history in terms of ratings, selection, etc
The engine makes predictions on what might interest a person based on the preferences of other users
In this algorithm, item features are unknown
For example, a sales page shows that a certain number of people buy a new phone and also buy tempered glass at the same time Next time, when a person buys a phone, he or she may see a recommendation to buy tempered glass as well",[]
104,13 What is a Generative Adversarial Network?,"Suppose there is a wine shop purchasing wine from dealers, which they resell later But some dealers sell fake wine In this case, the shop owner should be able to distinguish between fake and authentic wine The forger will try different techniques to sell fake wine and make sure specific techniques go past the shop owners check The shop owner would probably get some feedback from wine experts that some of the wine is not original The owner would have to improve how he determines whether a wine is fake or authentic
The forgers goal is to create wines that are indistinguishable from the authentic ones while the shop owner intends to tell if the wine is real or not accurately
There is a noise vector coming into the forger who is generating fake wine
Here the forger acts as a Generator
The shop owner acts as a Discriminator
The Discriminator gets two inputs; one is the fake wine, while the other is the real authentic wine
The shop owner has to figure out whether it is real or fake
So, there are two primary components of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) named:
The generator is a CNN that keeps keys producing images and is closer in appearance to the real images while the discriminator tries to determine the difference between real and fake images The ultimate aim
is to make the discriminator learn to identify real and fake images",[]
105,14 You are given a dataset on cancer detection You have built a classification model and achieved an accuracy of 96 percent Why shouldn't you be happy with your model performance? What can you do about it?,"Cancer detection results in imbalanced data In an imbalanced dataset, accuracy should not be based as a measure of performance It is important to focus on the remaining four percent, which represents the patients who were wrongly diagnosed Early diagnosis is crucial when it comes to cancer detection and can greatly improve a patient's prognosis
The target variable, in this case, is 1 (the last)
The formula for calculating the entropy is, putting  = 5 and  = 8, we get:
The most appropriate algorithm for this case is logistic regression",[]
106,"17 After studying the behavior of a population, you have identified four specific individual types that are valuable to your study You would like to find all users who are most similar to each individual type Which algorithm is most appropriate for this study?","As we are looking for grouping people together specifically by four different similarities, it indicates the value of k Therefore, K-means clustering is the most appropriate algorithm for this study
Hence, to evaluate model performance, we should use Sensitivity (True Positive Rate), Specificity (True
Negative Rate), F measure to determine the class wise performance of the classifier
The answer is A: {grape, apple} must be a frequent itemset",[]
107,19 Your organization has a website where visitors randomly receive one of two coupons It is also possible that visitors to the website will not receive a coupon You have been asked to determine if offering a coupon to website visitors has any impact on their purchase decisions Which analysis method should you use?,"One-way ANOVA: in statistics, one-way analysis of variance is a technique that can be used to compare means of two or more samples This technique can be used only for numerical response data, the ""Y"", usually one variable, and numerical or categorical input data, the ""X"", always one variable, hence ""one- way""
The ANOVA tests the null hypothesis, which states that samples in all groups are drawn from populations with the same mean values To do this, two estimates are made of the population variance The ANOVA produces an F-statistic, the ratio of the variance calculated among the means to the variance within the samples If the group means are drawn from populations with the same mean values, the variance between the group means should be lower than the variance of the samples, following the central limit theorem A higher ratio therefore implies that the samples were drawn from populations with different mean values",[]
108,20 What are the feature vectors?,"A feature vector is an n-dimensional vector of numerical features that represent an object In machine learning, feature vectors are used to represent numeric or symbolic characteristics (called features) of an object in a mathematical way that's easy to analyze",[]
109,21 What is root cause analysis?,Root cause analysis was initially developed to analyze industrial accidents but is now widely used in other areas It is a problem-solving technique used for isolating the root causes of faults or problems A factor is called a root cause if its deduction from the problem-fault-sequence averts the final undesirable event from recurring,[]
110,22 Do gradient descent methods always converge to similar points?,"https://wwwzdnetcom/article/the-top-cloud-providers-of-2020-aws-microsoft-azure-google-cloud- hybrid-saas/
They do not, because in some cases, they reach a local minimum or a local optimum point You would not
reach the global optimum point This is governed by the data and the starting conditions",[]
111,24 What is a Canary Deployment?,"https://wwwsplitio/glossary/canary-deployment/
A canary deployment, or canary release, allows you to rollout your features to only a subset of users as an initial test to make sure nothing else in your system broke
The initial steps for implementing canary deployment are:
When you deploy the new software version, you shift some percentage  say, 10%  of your user base to the new version while maintaining 90% of users on the old version If that 10% reports no errors, you can roll it out to gradually more users, until the new version is being used by everyone If the 10% has problems, though, you can roll it right back, and 90% of your users will have never even seen the problem
Canary deployment benefits include zero downtime, easy rollout and quick rollback  plus the added safety from the gradual rollout process It also has some drawbacks  the expense of maintaining multiple server instances, the difficult clone-or-dont-clone database decision
Typically, software development teams implement blue/green deployment when theyre sure the new version will work properly and want a simple, fast strategy to deploy it Conversely, canary deployment is most useful when the development team isnt as sure about the new version and they dont mind a slower rollout if it means theyll be able to catch the bugs",[]
112,25 What is a Blue Green Deployment?,"https://docscloudfoundryorg/devguide/deploy-apps/blue-greenhtml
Blue-green deployment is a technique that reduces downtime and risk by running two identical production environments called Blue and Green
At any time, only one of the environments is live, with the live environment serving all production traffic For this example, Blue is currently live, and Green is idle
As you prepare a new version of your model, deployment and the final stage of testing takes place in the environment that is not live: in this example, Green Once you have deployed and fully tested the model in Green, you switch the router, so all incoming requests now go to Green instead of Blue Green is now live, and Blue is idle
This technique can eliminate downtime due to app deployment and reduces risk: if something unexpected happens with your new version on Green, you can immediately roll back to the last version by switching back to Blue

uestions & Answers
Steve Nouri",[]
177,1 Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning?,"In supervised machine learning algorithms, we have to provide labeled data, for example, prediction of stock market prices, whereas in unsupervised we need not have labeled data, for example, classification of emails into spam and non-spam
Parametric models are those with a finite number of parameters To predict new data, you only need to know the parameters of the model Examples include linear regression, logistic regression, and linear SVMs
Non-parametric models are those with an unbounded number of parameters, allowing for more flexibility To predict new data, you need to know the parameters of the model and the state of the data that has been observed Examples include decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, and topic models using latent Dirichlet analysis",[]
178,3 What is the difference between classification and regression?,"Classification is used to produce discrete results, classification is used to classify data into some specific categories For example, classifying emails into spam and non-spam categories Whereas, We use regression analysis when we are dealing with continuous data, for example predicting stock prices at a certain point in time",[]
179,"4 What Is Overfitting, and How Can You Avoid It?","Overfitting is a situation that occurs when a model learns the training set too well, taking up random fluctuations in the training data as concepts These impact the models ability to generalize and dont apply to new data
When a model is given the training data, it shows 100 percent accuracytechnically a slight loss But, when we use the test data, there may be an error and low efficiency This condition is known as overfitting
There are multiple ways of avoiding overfitting, such as:
Regularization It involves a cost term for the features involved with the objective function
Making a simple model With lesser variables and parameters, the variance can be
reduced
Cross-validation methods like k-folds can also be used
If some model parameters are likely to cause overfitting, techniques for regularization
like LASSO can be used that penalize these parameters
",[]
180,5 What is meant by Training set and Test Set?,"We split the given data set into two different sections namely,Training set and Test Set Training set is the portion of the dataset used to train the model
Testing set is the portion of the dataset used to test the trained model",[]
181,6 How Do You Handle Missing or Corrupted Data in a Dataset?,"One of the easiest ways to handle missing or corrupted data is to drop those rows or columns or replace them entirely with some other value
There are two useful methods in Pandas:
IsNull() and dropna() will help to find the columns/rows with missing data and drop them
Fillna() will replace the wrong values with a placeholder value
In ensemble learning, many base models like classifiers and regressors are generated and combined together so that they give better results It is used when we build component classifiers that are accurate and independent There are sequential as well as parallel ensemble methods
Predictive models have a tradeoff between bias (how well the model fits the data) and variance (how much the model changes based on changes in the inputs)
Simpler models are stable (low variance) but they don't get close to the truth (high bias)
More complex models are more prone to overfitting (high variance) but they are expressive enough to get close to the truth (low bias) The best model for a given problem usually lies somewhere in the middle
gradient descent (GD)?
Both algorithms are methods for finding a set of parameters that minimize a loss function by evaluating parameters against data and then making adjustments
In standard gradient descent, you'll evaluate all training samples for each set of parameters This is akin to taking big, slow steps toward the solution
In stochastic gradient descent, you'll evaluate only 1 training sample for the set of parameters before updating them This is akin to taking small, quick steps toward the solution",[]
182,10 How Can You Choose a Classifier Based on a Training Set Data Size?,"When the training set is small, a model that has a right bias and low variance seems to work better because they are less likely to overfit

For example, Naive Bayes works best when the training set is large Models with low bias and high variance tend to perform better as they work fine with complex relationships",[]
183,"12 How much data should you allocate for your training, validation, and test sets?","You have to find a balance, and there's no right answer for every problem
If your test set is too small, you'll have an unreliable estimation of model performance (performance statistic will have high variance) If your training set is too small, your actual model parameters will have a high variance
A good rule of thumb is to use an 80/20 train/test split Then, your train set can be further split into train/validation or into partitions for cross-validation",[]
184,13 What Is a False Positive and False Negative and How Are They Significant?,"False positives are those cases which wrongly get classified as True but are False
False negatives are those cases which wrongly get classified as False but are True
In the term False Positive, the word Positive refers to the Yes row of the predicted value in the confusion matrix The complete term indicates that the system has predicted it as a positive, but the actual value is negative
L2 regularization tends to spread error among all the terms, while L1 is more binary/sparse, with many variables either being assigned a 1 or 0 in weighting L1 corresponds to setting a Laplacean prior to the terms, while L2 corresponds to a Gaussian prior",[]
185,15 Whats a Fourier transform?,"A Fourier transform is a generic method to decompose generic functions into a superposition of symmetric functions Or as this more intuitive tutorial puts it, given a smoothie, its how we find the recipe The Fourier transform finds the set of cycle speeds, amplitudes, and phases to match any time signal A Fourier transform converts a signal from time to frequency domain  its a very common way to extract features from audio signals or other time series such as sensor data",[]
186,"16 What is deep learning, and how does it contrast with other machine learning algorithms?","Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that is concerned with neural networks: how to use backpropagation and certain principles from neuroscience to more accurately model large sets of unlabelled or semi-structured data In that sense, deep learning represents an

unsupervised learning algorithm that learns representations of data through the use of neural nets",[]

In the case of semi-supervised learning, the training data contains a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data",[]
190,20 What Are Unsupervised Machine Learning Techniques?,"There are two techniques used in unsupervised learning: clustering and association
Clustering
Clustering problems involve data to be divided into subsets These subsets, also called clusters, contain data that are similar to each other Different clusters reveal different details about the objects, unlike classification or regression
Association

191,21 What Is naive in the Naive Bayes Classifier?,"The classifier is called naive because it makes assumptions that may or may not turn out to be correct
The algorithm assumes that the presence of one feature of a class is not related to the presence of any other feature (absolute independence of features), given the class variable
For instance, a fruit may be considered to be a cherry if it is red in color and round in shape, regardless of other features This assumption may or may not be right (as an apple also matches the description)
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a common method of topic modeling, or classifying documents by subject matter
LDA is a generative model that represents documents as a mixture of topics that each have their own probability distribution of possible words
The ""Dirichlet"" distribution is simply a distribution of distributions In LDA, documents are distributions of topics that are distributions of words
PCA is a method for transforming features in a dataset by combining them into uncorrelated linear combinations
These new features, or principal components, sequentially maximize the variance represented (ie the first principal component has the most variance, the second principal component has the second most, and so on)
As a result, PCA is useful for dimensionality reduction because you can set an arbitrary variance cutoff",[]

If the training dataset is large, use models that have high variance and little bias",[]
196,28 How Do You Design an Email Spam Filter?,"Building a spam filter involves the following process:
The email spam filter will be fed with thousands of emails
Each of these emails already has a label: spam or not spam
The supervised machine learning algorithm will then determine which type of emails are
being marked as spam based on spam words like the lottery, free offer, no money, full
refund, etc
The next time an email is about to hit your inbox, the spam filter will use statistical
analysis and algorithms like Decision Trees and SVM to determine how likely the email
is spam
If the likelihood is high, it will label it as spam, and the email wont hit your inbox

Based on the accuracy of each model, we will use the algorithm with the highest accuracy after testing all the models",[]
197,29 What evaluation approaches would you work to gauge the effectiveness of a machine learning model?,"You would first split the dataset into training and test sets, or perhaps use cross-validation techniques to further segment the dataset into composite sets of training and test sets within the data You should then implement a choice selection of performance metrics: here is a fairly comprehensive list You could use measures such as the F1 score, the accuracy, and the confusion matrix Whats important here is to demonstrate that you understand the nuances of how a model is measured and how to choose the right performance measures for the right situations",[]

It's equivalent to the expected probability that a uniformly drawn random positive is ranked before a uniformly drawn random negative
",[]
200,33 Why is Area Under ROC Curve (AUROC) better than raw accuracy as an out-of-sample evaluation metric?,"AUROC is robust to class imbalance, unlike raw accuracy

203,"37 What Is Pruning in Decision Trees, and How Is It Done?","Pruning is a technique in machine learning that reduces the size of decision trees It reduces the complexity of the final classifier, and hence improves predictive accuracy by the reduction of overfitting
Pruning can occur in:
Top-down fashion It will traverse nodes and trim subtrees starting at the root
Bottom-up fashion It will begin at the leaf nodes
There is a popular pruning algorithm called reduced error pruning, in which:
Starting at the leaves, each node is replaced with its most popular class
If the prediction accuracy is not affected, the change is kept
There is an advantage of simplicity and speed

216,50 When is Ridge regression favorable over Lasso regression?,"You can quote ISLRs authors Hastie, Tibshirani who asserted that, in the presence of few variables with medium / large sized effect, use lasso regression In presence of many variables with small/medium-sized effects, use ridge regression
Conceptually, we can say, lasso regression (L1) does both variable selection and parameter shrinkage, whereas Ridge regression only does parameter shrinkage and end up including all the coefficients in the model In the presence of correlated variables, ridge regression might be the preferred choice Also, ridge regression works best in situations where the least square estimates have higher variance Therefore, it depends on our model objective",[]

A linear model cant be used for discrete or binary outcomes
You cant vary the model flexibility of a linear model

265,15 TF-IDF helps you to establish?,"a most frequently occurring word in the document b most important word in the document
Answer : b) TF-IDF helps to establish how important a particular word is in the context of the document corpus TF-IDF takes into account the number of times the word appears in the document and offset by the number of documents that appear in the corpus
TF is the frequency of term divided by a total number of terms in the document
IDF is obtained by dividing the total number of documents by the number of documents
containing the term and then taking the logarithm of that quotient Steve Nouri https://wwwlinkedincom/in/stevenouri/
Tfidf is then the multiplication of two values TF and IDF

Dependency Parsing, also known as Syntactic parsing in NLP is a process of assigning syntactic structure to a sentence and identifying its dependency parses This process is crucial to understand the correlations between the head words in the syntactic structure
The process of dependency parsing can be a little complex considering how any sentence can have more than one dependency parses Multiple parse trees are known as ambiguities Dependency parsing needs to resolve these ambiguities in order to effectively assign a syntactic structure to a sentence

In NLP, perplexity is a way of evaluating language models Perplexity can be high and low; Low perplexity is ethical because the inability to deal with any complicated problem is less while high perplexity is terrible because the failure to deal with a complicated is high",[]
285,54 What is ngram in NLP?,"N-gram in NLP is simply a sequence of n words, and we also conclude the sentences which appeared more frequently, for example, let us consider the progression of these three words:
New York (2 gram)
The Golden Compass (3 gram)
She was there in the hotel (4 gram)
Now from the above sequence, we can easily conclude that sentence (a) appeared more frequently than the other two sentences, and the last sentence(c) is not seen that often Now if we assign probability in the occurrence of an n-gram, then it will be advantageous It would help in making next-word predictions and in spelling error corrections

288,58 What is Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI)?,"Steve Nouri https://wwwlinkedincom/in/stevenouri/
Latent semantic indexing is a mathematical technique used to improve the accuracy of the information retrieval process The design of LSI algorithms allows machines to detect the hidden (latent) correlation between semantics (words) To enhance information understanding, machines generate various concepts that associate with the words of a sentence
The technique used for information understanding is called singular value decomposition It is generally used to handle static and unstructured data The matrix obtained for singular value decomposition contains rows for words and columns for documents This method best suits to identify components and group them according to their types
The main principle behind LSI is that words carry a similar meaning when used in a similar context Computational LSI models are slow in comparison to other models However, they are good at contextual awareness that helps improve the analysis and understanding of a text or a document",[]

294,67 What are some ways we can preprocess text input?,"Here are several preprocessing steps that are commonly used for NLP tasks:
case normalization: we can convert all input to the same case (lowercase or uppercase)
as a way of reducing our text to a more canonical form
punctuation/stop word/white space/special characters removal: if we dont think these
words or characters are relevant, we can remove them to reduce the feature space
lemmatizing/stemming: we can also reduce words to their inflectional forms (ie walks
walk) to further trim our vocabulary
generalizing irrelevant information: we can replace all numbers with a <NUMBER> token
or all names with a <NAME> token",[]
295,68 How does the encoder-decoder structure work for language modelling?,"The encoder-decoder structure is a deep learning model architecture responsible for several state of the art solutions, including Machine Translation
The input sequence is passed to the encoder where it is transformed to a fixed-dimensional vector representation using a neural network The transformed input is then decoded using another neural network Then, these outputs undergo another transformation and a softmax layer The final output is a vector of probabilities over the vocabularies Meaningful information is extracted based on these probabilities",[]
296,69 What are attention mechanisms and why do we use them?,"This was a followup to the encoder-decoder question Only the output from the last time step is passed to the decoder, resulting in a loss of information learned at previous time steps This information loss is compounded for longer text sequences with more time steps
Attention mechanisms are a function of the hidden weights at each time step When we use attention in encoder-decoder networks, the fixed-dimensional vector passed to the decoder becomes a function of all vectors outputted in the intermediary steps
Two commonly used attention mechanisms are additive attention and multiplicative attention As the names suggest, additive attention is a weighted sum while multiplicative attention is a weighted multiplier of the hidden weights During the training process, the model also learns weights for the attention mechanisms to recognize the relative importance of each time step",[]

324,3 Why do we use convolutions for images rather than just FC layers?,"Firstly, convolutions preserve, encode, and actually use the spatial information from the image If we used only FC layers we would have no relative spatial information Secondly, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have a partially built-in translation in-variance, since each convolution kernel acts as it's own filter/feature detector",[]
325,4 What makes CNNs translation-invariant?,"As explained above, each convolution kernel acts as it's own filter/feature detector So let's say you're doing object detection, it doesn't matter where in the image the object is since we're going to apply the convolution in a sliding window fashion across the entire image anyways",[]
326,5 Why do we have max-pooling in classification CNNs?,for a role in Computer Vision Max-pooling in a CNN allows you to reduce computation since your feature maps are smaller after the pooling You don't lose too much semantic information since you're taking the maximum activation There's also a theory that max-pooling contributes a bit to giving CNNs more translation in-variance Check out this great video from Andrew Ng on the benefits of max-pooling,[]
327,6 Why do segmentation CNNs typically have an encoder-decoder style/structure?,"The encoder CNN can basically be thought of as a feature extraction network, while the decoder uses that information to predict the image segments by ""decoding"" the features and upscaling to the original image size
Steve Nouri",[]
328,7 What is the significance of Residual Networks?,"The main thing that residual connections did was allow for direct feature access from previous layers This makes information propagation throughout the network much easier One very interesting paper about this shows how using local skip connections gives the network a type of ensemble multi-path structure, giving features multiple paths to propagate throughout the network",[]
329,8 What is batch normalization and why does it work?,"Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change The idea is then to normalize the inputs of each layer in such a way that they have a mean output activation of zero and a standard deviation of one This is done for each individual mini-batch at each layer ie compute the mean and variance of that mini-batch alone, then normalize This is analogous to how the inputs to networks are standardized How does this help? We know that normalizing the inputs to a network helps it learn But a network is just a series of layers, where the output of one layer becomes the input to the next That means we can think of any layer in a neural network as the first layer of a smaller subsequent network Thought of as a series of neural networks feeding into each other, we normalize the output of one layer before applying the activation function and then feed it into the following layer (sub-network)",[]
330,9 Why would you use many small convolutional kernels such as 3x3 rather than a few large ones?,"This is very well explained in the VGGNet paper There are 2 reasons: First, you can use several smaller kernels rather than few large ones to get the same receptive field and capture more spatial context, but with the smaller kernels you are using less parameters and computations Secondly, because with smaller kernels you will be using more filters, you'll be able to use more activation functions and thus have a more discriminative mapping function being learned by your CNN",[]
331,10 What is Precision?,"Precision (also called positive predictive value) is the fraction of relevant instances among the retrieved instances
Precision = true positive / (true positive

332,11 What is Recall?,"Recall (also known as sensitivity) is the fraction of relevant instances that have been retrieved over the total amount of relevant instances Recall = true positive / (true positive

It is the weighted average of precision and recall It considers both false positive and false
negatives into account It is used to measure the models performance

334,16 What is Momentum (wrt NN optimization)?,"Momentum lets the optimization algorithm remembers its last step, and adds some proportion of it to the current step This way, even if the algorithm is stuck in a flat region, or a small local minimum, it can get out and continue towards the true minimum",[]
335,17 What is the difference between Batch Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent?,"Batch gradient descent computes the gradient using the whole dataset This is great for convex or relatively smooth error manifolds In this case, we move somewhat directly towards an optimum solution, either local or global Additionally, batch gradient descent, given an annealed learning rate, will eventually find the minimum located in its basin of attraction
Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) computes the gradient using a single sample SGD works well (Not well, I suppose, but better than batch gradient descent) for error manifolds that have lots of local maxima/minima In this case, the somewhat noisier gradient calculated using the reduced number of samples tends to jerk the model out of local minima into a region that hopefully is more optimal
Epoch: one forward pass and one backward pass of all the training examples Batch: examples processed together in one pass (forward and backward) Iteration: number of training examples / Batch size

336,19 What is the vanishing gradient?,"As we add more and more hidden layers, backpropagation becomes less and less useful in passing information to the lower layers In effect, as information is passed back, the gradients begin to vanish and become small relative to the weights of the networks",[]
337,20 What are dropouts?,"Dropout is a simple way to prevent a neural network from overfitting It is the dropping out of some of the units in a neural network It is similar to the natural reproduction process, where nature produces offsprings by combining distinct genes (dropping out others) rather than strengthening the co-adapting of them",[]
338,"21 Can you explain the differences between supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning?","In supervised learning, we train a model to learn the relationship between input data and output data We need to have labeled data to be able to do supervised learning
With unsupervised learning, we only have unlabeled data The model learns a representation of the data Unsupervised learning is frequently used to initialize the parameters of the model when we have a lot of unlabeled data and a small fraction of labeled data We first train an unsupervised model and, after that, we use the weights of the model to train a supervised model In reinforcement learning, the model has some input data and a reward depending on the output of the model The model learns a policy that maximizes the reward Reinforcement learning has been applied successfully to strategic games such as Go and even classic Atari video games",[]
339,22 What is data augmentation? Can you give some examples?,"Data augmentation is a technique for synthesizing new data by modifying existing data in such a way that the target is not changed, or it is changed in a known way Computer vision is one of the fields where data augmentation is very useful There are many modifications that we can do to images:
Resize
Horizontal or vertical flip
Rotate, Add noise, Deform
Modify colors Each problem needs a customized data augmentation pipeline For
example, on OCR, doing flips will change the text and wont be beneficial; however, resizes and small rotations may help",[]

343,26 How can you achieve Blurring through Gaussian Filter?,This is the most common technique for blurring or smoothing an image This filter improves the resulting pixel found at the center and slowly minimizes the effects as pixels move away from the center This filter can also help in removing noise in an image,[]
344,27 What is Non-Linear Filtering? How it is used?,"Linear filtering is easy to use and implement In some cases, this method is enough to get the necessary output However, an increase in performance can be obtained through non-linear filtering Through non-linear filtering, we can have more control and achieve better results when we encounter a more complex computer vision task
The median filter is an example of a non-linear filtering technique This technique is commonly used for minimizing the noise in an image It operates by inspecting the image pixel by pixel and taking the place of each pixels value with the value of the neighboring pixel median
Some techniques in detecting and matching features are:
Lucas-Kanade
Harris
Shi-Tomasi
SUSAN (smallest uni value segment assimilating nucleus)
MSER (maximally stable extremal regions)
SIFT (scale-invariant feature transform)
HOG (histogram of oriented gradients)
FAST (features from accelerated segment test)
SURF (speeded-up robust features)
SIFT solves the problem of detecting the corners of an object even if it is scaled Steps to implement this algorithm:
Scale-space extrema detection  This step will identify the locations and scales that can still be recognized from different angles or views of the same object in an image
Keypoint localization  When possible key points are located, they would be refined to get accurate results This would result in the elimination of points that are low in contrast or points that have edges that are deficiently localized
Orientation assignment  In this step, a consistent orientation is assigned to each key point to attain invariance when the image is being rotated
Keypoint matching  In this step, the key points between images are now linked to recognizing their nearest neighbors
Steve Nouri",[]
345,30 Why Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF) came into existence?,"SURF was introduced to as a speed-up version of SIFT Though SIFT can detect and describe key points of an object in an image, still this algorithm is slow",[]
346,31 What is Oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF (ORB)?,"This algorithm is a great possible substitute for SIFT and SURF, mainly because it performs better in computation and matching It is a combination of fast keypoint detector and brief descriptor, which contains a lot of alterations to improve performance It is also a great alternative in terms of cost because the SIFT and SURF algorithms are patented, which means that you need to buy them for their utilization",[]
347,32 What is image segmentation?,"In computer vision, segmentation is the process of extracting pixels in an image that is related Segmentation algorithms usually take an image and produce a group of contours (the boundary of an object that has well-defined edges in an image) or a mask where a set of related pixels are assigned to a unique color value to identify it
Popular image segmentation techniques:
Active contours
Level sets
Graph-based merging
Mean Shift
Texture and intervening contour-based normalized cuts",[]
348,33 What is the purpose of semantic segmentation?,"The purpose of semantic segmentation is to categorize every pixel of an image to a certain class or label In semantic segmentation, we can see what is the class of a pixel by simply looking directly at the color, but one downside of this is that we cannot identify if two colored masks belong to a certain object
In semantic segmentation, the only thing that matters to us is the class of each pixel This would somehow lead to a problem that we cannot identify if that class belongs to the same object or not Semantic segmentation cannot identify if two objects in an image are separate entities So to solve this problem, instance segmentation was created This segmentation can identify two different objects of the same class For example, if an image has two sheep in it, the sheep will be detected and masked with different colors to differentiate what instance of a class they belong to",[]
349,35 How is panoptic segmentation different from semantic/instance segmentation?,"Panoptic segmentation is basically a union of semantic and instance segmentation In panoptic segmentation, every pixel is classified by a certain class and those pixels that have several instances of a class are also determined For example, if an image has two cars, these cars will
Steve Nouri
be masked with different colors These colors represent the same class  car  but point to different instances of a certain class
Recognition is one of the toughest challenges in the concepts in computer vision Why is
recognition hard? For the human eyes, recognizing an objects features or attributes would be
very easy Humans can recognize multiple objects with very small effort However, this does not apply to a machine It would be very hard for a machine to recognize or detect an object because these objects vary They vary in terms of viewpoints, sizes, or scales Though these things are still challenges faced by most computer vision systems, they are still making advancements or approaches for solving these daunting tasks",[]
350,37 What is Object Recognition?,"Object recognition is used for indicating an object in an image or video This is a product of machine learning and deep learning algorithms Object recognition tries to acquire this innate human ability, which is to understand certain features or visual detail of an image",[]

352,40 What is Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)?,"HOG stands for Histograms of Oriented Gradients HOG is a type of feature descriptor The
intent of a feature descriptor is to generalize the object in such a way that the same object (in this case a person) produces as close as possible to the same feature descriptor when viewed under different conditions This makes the classification task easier

353,41 What is BOV: Bag-of-visual-words (BOV)?,"BOV also called the bag of keypoints, is based on vector quantization Similar to HOG features, BOV features are histograms that count the number of occurrences of certain patterns within a patch of the image",[]

356,45 Explain the concept of superpixel?,"A superpixel is an image patch that is better aligned with intensity edges than a rectangular patch Superpixels can be extracted with any segmentation algorithm, however, most of them produce highly irregular superpixels, with widely varying sizes and shapes A more regular space tessellation may be desired",[]
357,46 What is Non-maximum suppression(NMS) and where is it used?,"NMS is often used along with edge detection algorithms The image is scanned along the image gradient direction, and if pixels are not part of the local maxima they are set to zero It is widely used in object detection algorithms
Computer vision has also been an important part of advances in health-tech Computer vision algorithms can help automate tasks such as detecting cancerous moles in skin images or finding symptoms in x-ray and MRI scans
Computer vision also plays an important role in augmented and mixed reality, the technology that enables computing devices such as smartphones, tablets, and smart glasses to overlay and embed virtual objects on real-world imagery Using computer vision, AR gear detects objects in the real world in order to determine the locations on a devices display to place a virtual object For instance, computer vision algorithms can help AR applications detect planes such as
Steve Nouri
tabletops, walls, and floors, a very important part of establishing depth and dimensions and placing virtual objects in the physical world
Computer vision also plays an important role in facial recognition applications, the technology that enables computers to match images of peoples faces to their identities Computer vision algorithms detect facial features in images and compare them with databases of face profiles Consumer devices use facial recognition to authenticate the identities of their owners Social media apps use facial recognition to detect and tag users Law enforcement agencies also rely on facial recognition technology to identify criminals in video feeds
Computer vision enables self-driving cars to make sense of their surroundings Cameras capture video from different angles around the car and feed it to computer vision software, which then processes the images in real-time to find the extremities of roads, read traffic signs, detect other cars, objects, and pedestrians The self-driving car can then steer its way on streets and highways, avoid hitting obstacles, and (hopefully) safely drive its passengers to their destination
Many popular computer vision applications involve trying to recognize things in photographs; for example:
Object Object Object Object Object Object Object
Classification: What broad category of object is in this photograph? Identification: Which type of a given object is in this photograph? Verification: Is the object in the photograph?
Detection: Where are the objects in the photograph?
Landmark Detection: What are the key points for the object in the photograph? Segmentation: What pixels belong to the object in the image?
Recognition: What objects are in this photograph and where are they?
Computer vision is distinct from image processing
Image processing is the process of creating a new image from an existing image, typically simplifying or enhancing the content in some way It is a type of digital signal processing and is not concerned with understanding the content of an image
A given computer vision system may require image processing to be applied to raw input, eg pre-processing images
Examples of image processing include:
Normalizing photometric properties of the image, such as brightness or color
Cropping the bounds of the image, such as centering an object in a photograph
Removing digital noise from an image, such as digital artifacts from low light levels

364,61 What Will Happen If the Learning Rate Is Set Too Low or Too High?,"When your learning rate is too low, training of the model will progress very slowly as we are making minimal updates to the weights It will take many updates before reaching the minimum point If the learning rate is set too high, this causes undesirable divergent behavior to the loss function due to drastic updates in weights It may fail to converge (model can give a good output) or even diverge (data is too chaotic for the network to train)",[]
365,62 How Are Weights Initialized in a Network?,"There are two methods here: we can either initialize the weights to zero or assign them randomly Initializing all weights to 0: This makes your model similar to a linear model All the neurons and every layer perform the same operation, giving the same output and making the deep net useless Initializing all weights randomly: Here, the weights are assigned randomly by initializing them very close to 0 It gives better accuracy to the model since every neuron performs different computations This is the most commonly used method",[]

369,"66 What Is the Difference Between Epoch, Batch, and Iteration in Deep Learning?","Epoch - Represents one iteration over the entire dataset (everything put into the training model)
Batch - Refers to when we cannot pass the entire dataset into the neural network at once, so we divide the dataset into several batches

372,70 What Is an Auto-encoder?,This Neural Network has three layers in which the input neurons are equal to the output neurons The network's target outside is the same as the input It uses dimensionality reduction to restructure the input It works by compressing the image input to a latent space representation then reconstructing the output from this representation,[]
373,71 Can we have the same bias for all neurons of a hidden layer?,"Essentially, you can have a different bias value at each layer or at each neuron as well However, it is best if we have a bias matrix for all the neurons in the hidden layers as well
A point to note is that both these strategies would give you very different results",[]
374,"72 In a neural network, what if all the weights are initialized with the same value?","In simplest terms, if all the neurons have the same value of weights, each hidden unit will get exactly the same signal While this might work during forward propagation, the derivative of the cost function during backward propagation would be the same every time
Steve Nouri
In short, there is no learning happening by the network! What do you call the phenomenon of the model being unable to learn any patterns from the data? Yes, underfitting
Therefore, if all weights have the same initial value, this would lead to underfitting",[]
375,73 What is the role of weights and bias in a neural network?,"This is a question best explained with a real-life example Consider that you want to go out today to play a cricket match with your friends Now, a number of factors can affect your decision- making, like:
How many of your friends can make it to the game?
How much equipment can all of you bring?
What is the temperature outside?
And so on These factors can change your decision greatly or not too much For example, if it is raining outside, then you cannot go out to play at all Or if you have only one bat, you can share it while playing as well The magnitude by which these factors can affect the game is called the weight of that factor
Factors like the weather or temperature might have a higher weight, and other factors like equipment would have a lower weight",[]
376,74 Why does a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) work better with image data?,"The key to this question lies in the Convolution operation Unlike humans, the machine sees the image as a matrix of pixel values Instead of interpreting a shape like a petal or an ear, it just identifies curves and edges
Thus, instead of looking at the entire image, it helps to just read the image in parts Doing this for a 300 x 300-pixel image would mean dividing the matrix into smaller 3 x 3 matrices and dealing with them one by one This is convolution",[]
377,75 Why do RNNs work better with text data?,"The main component that differentiates Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) from the other models is the addition of a loop at each node This loop brings the recurrence mechanism in RNNs In a basic Artificial Neural Network (ANN), each input is given the same weight and fed to the network at the same time So, for a sentence like I saw the movie and hated it, it would be difficult to capture the information which associates it with the movie",[]
378,"76 In a CNN, if the input size 5 X 5 and the filter size is 7 X 7, then what would be the size of the output?","This is a pretty intuitive answer As we saw above, we perform the convolution on x one step at a time, to the right, and in the end, we got Z with dimensions 2 X 2, for X with dimensions 3 X 3 Thus, to make the input size similar to the filter size, we make use of padding  adding 0s to the input matrix such that its new size becomes at least 7 X 7 Thus, the output size would be using the formula:
Dimension of image = (n, n) = 5 X 5
Dimension of filter = (f,f) = 7 X 7

380,78 What are the applications of transfer learning in Deep Learning?,"I am sure you would have a doubt as to why a relatively simple question was included in the Intermediate Level The reason is the sheer volume of subsequent questions it can generate!

384,82 How Should we Evaluate GANs and When Should We Use Them?,"When it comes to evaluating GANs, there are many proposals but little consensus Suggestions include:
Steve Nouri
Inception Score and FID - Both these scores use a pre-trained image classifier and both have known issues A common criticism is that these scores measure sample quality and dont really capture sample diversity
MS-SSIM - propose using MS-SSIM to separately evaluate diversity, but this technique has some issues and hasnt really caught on
AIS - propose putting a Gaussian observation model on the outputs of a GAN and using annealed importance sampling to estimate the log-likelihood under this model, but show that estimates computed this way are inaccurate in the case where the GAN generator is also a flow model The generator being a flow model allows for the computation of exact log-likelihoods in this case
Geometry Score - suggest computing geometric properties of the generated data manifold and comparing those properties to the real data
Precision and Recall - attempt to measure both the precision and recall of GANs
Skill Rating - have shown that trained GAN discriminators can contain useful information
with which evaluation can be performed",[]
385,83 What should we use GANs for?,"If you want an actual density model, GANs probably isnt the best choice There is now good experimental evidence that GANs learn a low support representation of the target dataset, which means there may be substantial parts of the test set to which a GAN (implicitly) assigns zero likelihood",[]
386,84 How should we evaluate GANs on these perceptual tasks?,"Ideally, we would just use a human judge, but this is expensive A cheap proxy is to see if a classifier can distinguish between real and fake examples This is called a classifier two-sample test (C2STs) The main issue with C2STs is that if the Generator has even a minor defect thats systematic across samples (eg, ) this will dominate the evaluation
Research has suggested that if your discriminator is too good, then generator training can fail due to vanishing gradients In effect, an optimal discriminator doesn't provide enough information for the generator to make progress
Attempts to Remedy
Wasserstein loss: The Wasserstein loss is designed to prevent vanishing gradients even when you train the discriminator to optimality
Modified minimax loss: The original GAN paper proposed a modification to minimax loss to deal with vanishing gradients",[]
387,86 What is Mode Collapse and why it is a big issue?,"Usually, you want your GAN to produce a wide variety of outputs You want, for example, a different face for every random input to your face generator
However, if a generator produces an especially plausible output, the generator may learn to produce only that output In fact, the generator is always trying to find the one output that seems most plausible to the discriminator
Steve Nouri
If the generator starts producing the same output (or a small set of outputs) over and over again, the discriminator's best strategy is to learn to always reject that output But if the next generation of discriminator gets stuck in a local minimum and doesn't find the best strategy, then it's too easy for the next generator iteration to find the most plausible output for the current discriminator Each iteration of generator over-optimizes for a particular discriminator and the discriminator never manages to learn its way out of the trap As a result, the generators rotate through a small set of output types This form of GAN failure is called mode collapse
In a progressive GAN, the generator's first layers produce very low resolution images, and subsequent layers add details This technique allows the GAN to train more quickly than comparable non-progressive GANs, and produces higher resolution images
Conditional GANs train on a labeled data set and let you specify the label for each generated instance For example, an unconditional MNIST GAN would produce random digits, while a conditional MNIST GAN would let you specify which digit the GAN should generate
Instead of modeling the joint probability P(X, Y), conditional GANs model the conditional probability P(X | Y)
For more information about conditional GANs, see Mirza et al, 2014
Image-to-Image translation GANs take an image as input and map it to a generated output image with different properties For example, we can take a mask image with blob of color in the shape of a car, and the GAN can fill in the shape with photorealistic car details
CycleGANs learn to transform images from one set into images that could plausibly belong to another set For example, a CycleGAN produced the righthand image below when given the lefthand image as input It took an image of a horse and turned it into an image of a zebra",[]
388,91 What is Super-resolution?,"Super-resolution GANs increase the resolution of images, adding detail where necessary to fill in blurry areas For example, the blurry middle image below is a downsampled version of the original image on the left Given the blurry image, a GAN produced the sharper image on the right:
Many GAN models suffer the following major problems:
Non-convergence: the model parameters oscillate, destabilize and never converge,
Mode collapse: the generator collapses which produces limited varieties of samples,
Steve Nouri
Diminished gradient: the discriminator gets too successful that the generator gradient vanishes and learns nothing,
Unbalance between the generator and discriminator causing overfitting, &
Highly sensitive to the hyperparameter selections",[]
389,93 Describe Cost vs image quality in GANS?,"In a discriminative model, the loss measures the accuracy of the prediction and we use it to monitor the progress of the training However, the loss in GAN measures how well we are doing compared with our opponent Often, the generator cost increases but the image quality is actually improving We fall back to examine the generated images manually to verify the progress This makes model comparison harder which leads to difficulties in picking the best model in a single run It also complicates the tuning process",[]
390,94 Why Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used in Computer Vision?,The singular value decomposition is the most common and useful decomposition in computer vision The goal of computer vision is to explain the three-dimensional world through two- dimensional pictures,[]
391,95 What Is Image Transform?,"An image can be expanded in terms of a discrete set of basis arrays called basis images Hence, these basis images can be generated by unitary matrices An NxN image can be viewed as an N^21 vector It provides a set of coordinates or basis vectors for vector space",[]
392,96 List The Hardware Oriented Color Models?,"They are as follows  RGB model
CMY model
YI
model
HSI model",[]
393,96 What Is The Need For Transform?,"Answer: The need for transform is most of the signals or images are time-domain signal (ie) signals can be measured with a function of time This representation is not always best Any person of the mathematical transformations is applied to the signal or images to obtain further information from that signal Particularly, for image processing",[]
